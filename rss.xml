  <title>Open Roads Review – Stuck In First Gear

  &lt;p&gt;
              &lt;b&gt;Reviewed on:&lt;/b&gt;
      PC
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Platform:&lt;/b&gt;
      PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt;
      Annapurna Interactive
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developer:&lt;/b&gt;
      Open Roads Team
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Tess and her mother, Opal, have a lot on their plates. In addition to losing their grandmother/mother, they must quickly move out of her now-foreclosed home. Tess is graduating high school and is conflicted over whether to go to college or pursue her personal web design business. Opal is cross at her sister August’s refusal to help with the move. She also finds herself playing the “bad cop” in the complicated relationship between Tess and her father. And if that wasn’tenough, they also discover a secret surrounding their grandmother that could change everything they thought they knew about their family. Compelled to learn more, Tess and Opal embark on a road trip to learn the truth. I was as captivated by the mystery as the characters at the start, but this road trip peters out after a few miles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Roads’ hooks are initially enticing, and strong performances from the lead actresses – Kaitlyn Dever (Tess) and Keri Russell (Opal) – drive the story forward. Open Road’s art direction is also a highlight, with Opal and Tess depicted as 2D hand-drawn characters against 3D environments. It gives a fitting, distinct look, but the lack of lip sync and limited facial animations sometimes diminish the weight of more emotional line deliveries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BdKSaEFAE0Y" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players control Tess, and despite the premise, sitting in the car and chatting with Opal only accounts for less than half of the adventure. The rest of the game unfolds as a first-person adventure more in line with The Open Roads Team’s first title, Gone Home, in that you explore a few densely detailed environments to inspect objects for clues. I enjoy the personal hand-crafted touches of these items (such as the team member’s actual handwriting on notes) and how they immersed me in 2003 Michigan without the need for words. Playing on PC, controller support feels hit and miss as the camera sometimes snaps to odd angles after inspecting items.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Roads’ laid-back atmosphere means no problem ever evolves beyond finding the right object to advance the plot, looking for keys to open doors, or finding alternative routes into areas. I hesitate to call any obstacles true puzzles, as solutions boil down to picking up everything until you find what you need. Some items prompt Tess to call Opal over to have a discussion about it, which can lead to some humorous or serious anecdotes. More often, however, an ashtray or cup is just an ashtray or cup.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/16/04d0e561/opalattic.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/16/7eac5ab9/open_roads_header.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/16/4bd6e9b0/attic.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/16/5666a9a9/bedroom.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/16/f9110ab9/dearmilliebook.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/16/b438d82e/francinephoto.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The story is king here, but its initial intrigue gradually loses steam. The central mystery results in an underwhelming revelation, and the resolutions of other threads are largely left up in the air. Even Tess and Opal’s relationship doesn’t evolve much. By design, dialogue choices don’t meaningfully alter the story’s trajectory or Opal’s view of you. You may elicit a particularly terse response, but nothing Tess says, nor the big reveals, changes the overall dynamic of their contentious but loving relationship in a significant way. The result is a story with stakes that feel lower and less impactful than I initially expected, and while it has good moments, it left me wanting more.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a brief runtime of a couple of hours, Open Roads is a respectable tale that sometimes feels ready to hit that higher narrative gear before easing off the gas again. Although visually pleasing and well-acted, the emotional impact is muted. While I didn’t mind sitting shotgun as Opal and Tess had lighthearted debates over the semantics of trailer vs. mobile homes and reminisced about old flames, it’s not a road trip that will stick with me for the long haul.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Pepper Grinder Review - Short And Spicy
</title>
  <link>https://www.gameinformer.com/review/pepper-grinder/short-and-spicy</link>
  <description>
                                    



      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/28/67ac5f9d/pepper_grinder_1.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
              &lt;b&gt;Reviewed on:&lt;/b&gt;
      Switch
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Platform:&lt;/b&gt;
      Switch, PC
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt;
      Devolver Digital
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developer:&lt;/b&gt;
      Ahr Ech
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Sometimes, all it takes to get started on a great game is to come up with a compelling mechanic, and Pepper Grinder is a prime example. The titular grinder is as powerful as it is versatile, able to drill through the ground and power all sorts of wacky devices. The difficulty curve can be choppy, and ends more quickly than it should, but that core mechanic builds a sturdy foundation that kept me entertained from start to finish. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;That core mechanic is, of course, the Grinder, a conical drilling device protagonist Pepper uses to burrow through terrain, spin switches, and defeat enemies. Level design is consistently clever, and I won't spoil anything, but I was impressed by the number of uses the team found for a device that could easily get old quickly. That said, while popping in and out of dirt patches, swinging on grappling hooks, and boosting over gaps is fun, it's not as easy as it looks.&lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/28/1eb1ffef/pepper_grinder_4.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Don't let Pepper Grinder's pixel art and cheery exterior fool you – this game can get tough, particularly in its platforming challenges. Some jumps need to be boosted at just the right time, and if you're not ready for a certain grapple point to appear, you plummet to your death. The hardest levels are Pepper Grinder's boss stages, thrilling battles that make creative use of the game's mechanics. Because bosses have large health bars, these are tests of endurance, but despite that, they manage to maintain the game's blisteringly fast pace. The arenas and the bosses themselves also look fantastic, showcasing developer Ahr Ech's talent for pixel art at the highest degree.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;While I enjoy being challenged, the difficulty sometimes frustrated me with its inconsistency, with one level killing me repeatedly and the next one flying by without harming me once. Dying against a tough boss was never an issue because their difficulty is well-forecasted and fitting, but some levels have difficult jump sequences or waves of enemies right before a checkpoint, which annoyed me when I had to try again and again. While there are a few reasons this can happen, it's at least partially a symptom of the game's length; including fewer levels makes it harder to smooth out the difficulty curve, resulting in spikes like this. &lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/28/a15a22f0/pepper_grinder_2.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;I've alluded to it a few times, but Pepper Grinder is a surprisingly short experience. It only took me three and a half hours to complete the main story and then another half hour or so to go back and collect enough coins to play the locked levels I'd skipped over. I don't mind short games, but rolling credits on this one caught me off guard. There are plenty of ideas and mechanics that could have easily been expanded, and by extending the earlier part of the game, the difficulty spikes near the end likely wouldn't be as frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;That said, I do appreciate its efficiency. Ahr Ech had an idea for a platforming mechanic and iterated on it just enough to complete a story – there's not a wasted moment in the entire playthrough, and that's more than a lot of games can say. Pepper Grinder is a well-cooked meal – I just wish the portion was bigger.&lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/28/0abb898a/pepper_grinder_3.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;And there are ways to spend more time with the game after defeating the final boss. In addition to a time attack mode, completionists will be glad to see five collectible skull coins in each level, though they're worth collecting for more casual players, too. With 10, you can access a locked level in each world, and they're some of the most enjoyable levels in the entire game, sometimes even introducing completely new mechanics. Skull coins can also be used to unlock hair and clothing colors, but I wish they were separate – it feels odd to choose between playing more of the game and changing my hair color. I recommend prioritizing level unlocks, but I won't blame you for springing for the pink hair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Pepper Grinder is an innovative indie experience, packed with tense battles, fluid platforming, and eye-catching visual design. While its short runtime left me wanting more, I'm happy with what it is: a bright action platformer that's anything but a grind.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Contra: Operation Galuga Review - Finding A Way Forward
</title>

  <description>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    



      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/27/11d65cf7/contra4.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="Contra: Operation Galuga" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
              &lt;b&gt;Reviewed on:&lt;/b&gt;
      Switch
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Platform:&lt;/b&gt;
      PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, PC
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt;
      Konami
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developer:&lt;/b&gt;
      WayForward Technologies
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Teen
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Once a tentpole franchise in the popular run-and-gun subgenre of action games, Contra has experienced a stark downturn in recent decades. Konami's (mostly) side-scrolling shooter franchise has often gone long stretches without a release, and the games that have come out in recent years range from middling to downright bad. With Contra: Operation Galuga, Konami taps renowned retro-style developer WayForward, best known for its work on the Shantae series, to bring the once-renowned series back to its roots. While far from a one-to-one remake, Contra: Operation Galuga effectively captures the spirit of the original game while modernizing just enough to make for an exciting, albeit short, adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core conceits of the original Contra carry forward into this modern reimagining. Smooth platforming, solid 2D gunplay, and a wealth of power-ups are at your disposal as you take on a tough-as-nails campaign consisting of eight missions. The spread gun power-up remains extremely effective, but I adored blasting through hordes of enemies with items like the flamethrower, heat-seeking missiles, and lasers. Operation Galuga ups the ante by allowing you to stack power-ups, meaning the upgrade becomes more potent if you gather duplicate power-ups. On top of that, if you find your back against the wall or you're about to pick up a new power-up, you can sacrifice your existing weapon to unleash a powerful Overload ability. These ultimate-style abilities provide aid in the form of additions like drones, shields, and clusters of attacks. I loved balancing the risk and reward of maximizing damage and effectiveness in tough combat scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJrUmVuYcro" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WayForward proves supremely capable of delivering stellar gameplay and strong level design within the confines of the established classic Contra games. By using the original levels more as guides than slavishly adhering to their layouts, WayForward competently injects big setpiece moments late '80s technology could only dream of.&amp;nbsp;Though the initial level and the ascent up a waterfall hold a special place in my heart due to nostalgia, I most enjoyed when WayForward added elements like a hoverbike to the base mission, or inserting a train into the ice level. Though there are only eight missions in Story Mode, these different formats go a long way to diversifying the experience, as do the multiple unlockable characters, each with unique special abilities.&amp;nbsp;However, I am disappointed in the lack of 3D-style shooting gallery levels that were so iconic in the original NES game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional enemy types, bosses, and areas to explore pad out the stages, and unless you hone your skills, it will be an uphill battle to get through Story Mode. While the term "bullet hell" wasn't yet coined when Contra hit the NES in 1988, that term can retroactively be applied to certain sequences of that title. Those same sections have been reimagined and easily earn that designation in Operation Galuga. On various occasions, it took me multiple attempts to understand what I even needed to do to push through a difficult situation and, even more still, to execute the plan. True to its source material, Operation Galuga is a hard game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, you can adjust the difficulty in a couple of ways to make it more approachable. In both Story and Arcade Mode, you can choose a difficulty setting and decide if you'd rather have your character operate on the one-hit kill style of the original game or if you want HP associated with each life. These modernizations drastically improve the experience, though don't expect these settings to make the missions a walk in the park.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These settings also don't impact the aptly named Challenge Mode, which gives you 30 bite-sized objectives to complete. You can try your hand at speedrun, survival, boss battle, and weapon-specific challenges, but outside of the initial attempts, I never felt compelled to return to these. Arcade Mode offers a similar experience to that of Story Mode, but minus the superfluous cutscenes and narrative character restrictions. You can also play Arcade Mode in four-player co-op instead of the two-player limit in Story.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/27/8c9a1653/contra1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/27/fdf51a14/contra2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/27/32a7f688/contra3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/27/b66c49e1/contra5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/27/7c889596/contra6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/27/78a08432/contra7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/27/729445f5/contra8.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;All these activities reward you with credits, which are used to buy perks from the in-game shop. These equippable boosts offer upgrades like additional HP, extra lives, new characters in Arcade Mode, and even bonuses like additional soundtracks and a fast-paced Speedrun Mode. Unfortunately, the perks are expensive, and I grew tired of farming credits long before I reached the amount I needed for the perks I was eyeing. Even entering the famous Konami Code just adds an expensive, purchasable perk in the shop.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though the stages are much longer than their original forms, sometimes clocking in at around 15 minutes, playing through Story Mode only takes a couple of hours. Still, Contra: Operation Galuga packs a whole lot of action into those hours. When you add the more flexible Arcade Mode and difficult Challenge Mode, Operation Galuga is an admirable modernized reimagining of one of the most influential games of the late '80s.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;MLB The Show’s commitment to nuance, iteration, and diversity is what sets it apart. Since the long-running series arrived on Xbox in 2021, the baseball sim has recontextualized sports games – emphasizing the purpose of communities while fitting in new features like Pinpoint Pitching, custom stadiums, and online ranked co-op. The Show 23 pushed the bar further with Storylines: The Negro Leagues, an interactive museum that detailed eight stars of baseball’s segregated past. This year’s iteration mirrors it with new Storyline episodes, a 60-minute tribute to Yankee legend Derek Jeter, and an original RTTS narrative where “Women Pave Their Way.” While it isn’t a hyper-creative leap forward, MLB The Show 24 finds a new swing by tethering style and strategy to baseball’s fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MLB The Show 24’s gameplay is almost identical to The Show 23 – complete with 23’s quirks (Break Outlier, Pick Off Artist), throwing interfaces, swing feedback, and updates to attributes that associate the clutch attribute with RISP. There are 400 new animations in 24, plus logic improvements, new base sizes, and “Impact Plays” that add major league realism to defensive assists. However, it lacks an innovative change to a hitting and pitching engine we’ve seen in past entries. The new face and hair details are a sight to behold when Bryce Harper and Fernando Tatis Jr. are bat-flipping home runs next to cherry-kissed skies, but the immersion breaks when a star player drops a pop fly, misses routine grounders at third, or “soft tosses” a double play ball in extra innings. The Show 24’s updated lighting system provides a sharper, detailed look at the diamonds across Major League Baseball, and it takes advantage of a boost in exit velocities. This shift makes it easier to hit the ball in Petco Park, Chase Field, and Kauffman Stadium, all of which were problematic in past entries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As expected, Storylines: Season Two is a delight. The docuseries, narrated by Negro Leagues Baseball Museum President Bob Kendrick, stands by the NLBM’s mission to “educate, enlighten, and inspire,” and it continues to combine archival footage, gameplay-driven scenarios, and personal anecdotes to illustrate why baseball is the most romanticized sport on Earth. The new season introduces 10 new Negro League heroes, with four episodes available at launch – reducing the initial runtime to institute a more immersive environment for Kendrick’s narrations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N8SoZ-aLqTY" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it doesn’t miss. Season Two embraces the Negro Leagues’ revered architects, highlighting how the introduction of “night baseball” in the 1930s led to the discovery of a phenom known as Josh “The Black Babe Ruth” Gibson. It recalls how Walter “Buck” Leonard was a thinking man’s player and a fixture for Pittsburgh’s Homestead Greys; how Henry “The Hammer” Aaron started his career with the 1952 Indianapolis Clowns as a “skinny, cross-handed hitting” shortstop; and how Toni “The Trailblazer” Stone learned how to play with the fellas before becoming the first of three pioneering women to play professional ball. All four narratives are accompanied by iconic moments – such as recreating Stone’s single against the immortal Satchel Paige and hitting a home run with Aaron and the Milwaukee Braves in Sportsman’s Park – and it never once feels overly dramatized. Instead, every photograph, audio excerpt, and subtle ode to Pennsylvania’s Greenlee Field and Newark’s Ruppert Stadium is an organic lesson in American history. Bold and full of soul thanks to scores by Stevie Wonder, Marlena Shaw, and A Tribe Called Quest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That attention to detail is also embedded in Storylines: Derek Jeter – a ‘90s-based spinoff mode that pays homage to “The Captain” and his New York Yankees-inflected path to baseball nobility. Much like Season Two, it’s a collection of career-defining, playable moments from 1995 to 2000, including his first career hit versus the Mariners in Seattle’s Kingdome, his famous “jump throw” from Game 1 of the 1998 American League Championship, and how the Yankees’ initial All-Star Game MVP drove the club past the New York Mets to seal a three-peat in the 2000 World Series. It’s not the most compelling narrative, particularly if you’re a fan of the Yankees’ rivals, but thanks to San Diego Studio’s Live Content team, it does offer a surplus of in-game rewards, including Atlanta’s 2000 All-Star Game uniforms and Subway Series player items for Diamond Dynasty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also an interactive subway map, complete with graffiti, billboards, and “New York-isms", that provides a snapshot of the city and a fan base with high expectations, but it’s difficult not to imagine Storylines being a distinctive voice for pockets of culture that are less commercialized.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other modes like Franchise and March To October have been largely untouched – pairing The Show 23’s amateur scouting system, postseason formats, and “Ohtani Rule” with custom game conditions and Prospect Promotion Incentive (PPI). Road To The Show is directly tied to the Draft Combine, a four-day event where hitting, pitching, and fielding is graded to provide an accurate projection for attributes, comparisons, and club interest for the MLB Draft. It provides explanations for multiple ballplayer archetypes and their position’s focus, but the core narrative lacks creative ingenuity that goes beyond dated minigames and dialogue systems. Especially when it reaffirms what the community already knows: RTTS is for ‘80s mullets and XP bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Women Pave Their Way” is a fresh addition that alters the Road To The Show formula in new and exciting ways because it presents an atypical narrative about breaking barriers in baseball. It’s a unique pivot, led by narrative designer Mollie Braley and USA Baseball’s Kelsie Whitmore, and it’s one that promotes awareness of the women who play baseball and that other aspiring athletes are capable of competing at multiple levels. It sounds like “marketing jazz,” but Braley and SDS use pre-recorded video content with MLB Network’s Robert Flores, Lauren Shehadi, Dan O’Dowd, Melanie Newman, and Carlos Peña to stress the physical and mental adversity that is attached to carving a path in minor-league systems. They don’t sugarcoat anxieties or rewrite old baseball traditions; their intention is to inspire new and returning players to chase their lifelong dreams, and it’s a vision that gets its own full circle moment when MLB.com’s Sarah Langs starts detailing RPMs and spin rates.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;With the exit velocities, Diamond Dynasty is off to its best start in years. The Show 24 alters 23’s Ultimate Team concepts to reintroduce “Seasons 2.0” – an expansion on “Sets &amp;amp; Seasons” that ditches 99 OVR player items on Day One for a traditional power creep, multiple Wild Card slots, monthly Team Affinity drops, and reward paths that differentiate Ranked, Events, and Conquest. There are Cornerstone Captains that implement seasonal archetypes for team building and new Team Captains that add comparable boosts to hitting and pitching attributes for all 30 MLB clubs – solely to create hypotheticals like Yankees vs Dodgers, Cubs vs Phillies, and Rays vs Padres. There are still microtransactions, sure, but The Show’s monetization policies are less iniquitous than Madden NFL, FIFA, and NBA 2K’s practices because they rarely “gatekeep” limited drops when there are hundreds of diamond player items “sitting at home.” Diamond Dynasty is still in need of a visual overhaul, a Custom Practice mode, a new uniform creation system, and more unique customization options that tap into collaborations with Sanford Greene, King Saladeen, and Takashi Okazaki, but listening to a community’s input is a start – especially if it continues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MLB The Show 24 doesn’t hit it out of the park at every at-bat, but it doesn’t have to. The series is in the middle of an experimental phase that’s trying to mitigate its perpetual “online vs. offline” war. Despite a clear lack of innovation in mechanics, it has still found a way to impress, inspire, and engage with a younger generation that shares an interest in history. The Show’s art team is second to none, its OST shuffles Eladio Carrion, IDLES, Flowdan, and Brittany Howard with the grace of a 2 Chainz verse, and its “Grind 99” mantra has been edited to be a modern ideology – “play however and whenever.” It’s why Diamond Dynasty is the best take on Ultimate Team in terms of approachability and competition and why The Show 24 hopes to reignite annual titles through personalization. As the great Toni Stone once implied: “Get you one ‘cause I got mine.”&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Princess Peach: Showtime Review - Unassuming Encore

      Nintendo
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;We’ve played as Peach in plenty of Mario-starring games through the years, but not since 2005’s Super Princess Peach has the artist formerly known as Princess Toadstool been the exclusive protagonist of her own journey. Princess Peach: Showtime is a wholly original adventure with an impressive amount of unique mechanics, but it fails to reach the platforming heights Nintendo has attained with its other characters in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhEi1WeaBGY" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showtime’s overall premise is one of the highlights as it creates an aesthetically interesting world that is able to look and play differently from level to level but still maintain a consistent and welcoming style. While visiting a theatre to take in a show, the facility is attacked by the Sour Bunch for reasons that are ultimately unimportant. What is important is Peach is put in charge of returning everything to normal because she happens to be present and capable – a classic &lt;em&gt;Die Hard&lt;/em&gt; scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The design of every level leans into the theatre premise with a spotlight following Peach as she progresses, set changes marking new areas, and strings from the rafters being used to make elements look like they’re floating through the air. Seeing what every new stage looks like is fun, even for the repeated themes, but Peach’s costume changes are the primary focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peach has multiple costumes that dictate her distinct abilities in different levels and while they are not all winners, they are all at least solid. I particularly like the ninja costume with its breezy combat and goofy stealth abilities, but then there are costumes like the detective that I found laborious to use. Meanwhile, costumes like the dashing thief and the cowboy that function similarly (one casts out a line with a grappling gun, the other casts out a line with a lasso) feel different thanks to the unique levels they are placed in.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/4d1db111/princesspeachshowtime_cosmetics2.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/4a965832/princesspeachshowtime_rehearsal3_en.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/7cb90be7/princesspeachshowtime_cosmetics3.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/48d37c75/princesspeachshowtime_rehearsal5_en.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/5432c554/princesspeachshowtime_shop_en.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/72d4334a/princesspeachshowtime_demo2.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/3cfc58de/princesspeachshowtime_theater.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/dbfb90a1/princesspeachshowtime_demo3.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/9e0c5095/princesspeachshowtime_demo4.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/2909805c/princesspeachshowtime_demo5.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/17a53b8f/princesspeachshowtime_fencer1.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/e3d01c25/princesspeachshowtime_fencer2.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/179cc9ba/princesspeachshowtime_boss2.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/029efd5f/princesspeachshowtime_fencer3.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/516fe3bd/princesspeachshowtime_cosmetics1_en.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/15/949ead04/princesspeachshowtime_rehearsal2_en.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The art direction and presentation are well done, but I struggled sometimes with the difficulty. Not because the game is hard – Showtime is an easy game by design – but there are occasions where I found specific jumps or minigames annoying to complete. It plays like a great first game for a new player to potentially enjoy alongside a parent, but there are little pockets where I had to time attacks properly or make a number of timed jumps that felt too hard in the context of the rest of the game. The challenge sits in an uncomfortable middle ground of being too easy for veteran players but not easy enough for rookies.&lt;br /&gt;
The rewards for collecting coins also underwhelmed. I enjoyed seeing Peach adopt all kinds of different outfits and styles in the levels, but the only option for unlocks with your hard-earned money outside the levels are different patterns for Peach’s iconic dress. I am disappointed there weren’t options for completely different dress styles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got distracted occasionally by Showtime’s performance. I am not a player overly concerned with framerates; I prefer 60 FPS, but will happily take 30 FPS, as long as it is consistent, which is where this game struggles. Showtime hitches occasionally, not often during high-pressure moments, thankfully, but during the moments when you are relaxing in the theatre's main hallways. It’s a plague the Switch hardware is dealing with more and more, and Showtime is just another reminder that the console is struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Princess Peach: Showtime could be a decent first game for young Peach fans, but longtime Nintendo players looking for the Princess’ equivalent of a quality Kirby platformer will likely be underwhelmed. Stylistically, however, the game is a success and, in typical Nintendo fashion, features an exciting finale. I just wish the difficulty had been more balanced in one direction or the other.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
              &lt;b&gt;Reviewed on:&lt;/b&gt;
      PlayStation 5
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Platform:&lt;/b&gt;
      PlayStation 5
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt;
      Koei Tecmo
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developer:&lt;/b&gt;
      Team Ninja
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;“In a mad world, only the mad are sane,” a stirring line from Akira Kurosawa’s 1985 samurai epic &lt;em&gt;Ran&lt;/em&gt;, urges us to remember that in times of chaos, strange or unconventional ideas may actually be wise. In Rise of the Rōnin, I argue Team Ninja exemplifies that madness with an open-world title far outside its usual comfort zone. Unfortunately, even in a mad world, seeing the wisdom in many of the decisions made here is difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rise of the Rōnin is Team Ninja’s first open world, set against a backdrop of 19th century Japan to tell a historical story of political upheaval and revolution. As a new pathway for a developer that primarily focuses on tightly designed levels, there is little to be upset about in its open-world execution. It is, lamentably, about as standard as open-world design comes, with content littered across the map but little of it compelling enough to seek out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0gwsQvDGh4o" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Collecting cats for one quest-giver, foreign books for another, photographs for a third, and so on, starts out feeling shallow and only ends up crumbling into busywork that grates over time more than it enhanced. These activities are clearly meant to freshen up the standard gameplay loop with distractions, but they left me scratching my head at the necessity of being an open-world game in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a successor to games like Nioh and Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty, Rise of the Rōnin once again employs Team Ninja’s parry-heavy core to an impressive degree. Even when I might prefer to use stealth, most missions eventually become parry-fests where I wait for an enemy to get aggressive and go back and forth until I can perform a critical attack in return. Like those previous games in Team Ninja’s portfolio, it is consistently exciting to successfully parry every strike of an enemy’s combo and make them pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Rōnin suffers is how intensely concentrated the game is on this single mechanic, as fun as it may be, to the exclusion of all other variety. The repetition of solving every single problem in the game with parries takes an often enjoyable action and forces me to do it thousands of times with little in the way of combat diversity. I began to feel like a hammer in a world full of nails with a litany of the same tasks to do that lost their novelty long before I hit the credits, regardless of the different stances and skills that do not feel especially additive to the experience.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Team Ninja made a conscious effort to limit enemies to humans in this history-based story, as opposed to the demons and monsters and other supernatural creatures of the night. While understandable, this self-imposed restriction to the assortment of enemies exacerbates the echoing monotony that builds toward the end of the game. There are only so many Very Large Men with Two Swords I could come across before feeling like I had fought entirely too many of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rise of the Rōnin’s sweeping green fields and cascading waves of falling red leaves paint a beautiful picture that the game’s graphical prowess does not keep up with. Aesthetically, it makes the open world feel peaceful, but sometimes shoddy character models and simplistic environments break that immersion in half. The game’s graphical fidelity mode is borderline unplayable, with framerates that would test even the most stalwart frame-ignorer of their tolerances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost nothing in Rise of the Rōnin is outright bad, but it is Exhibit A in any argument about why action games are not dozens of hours long or why open-world designs do not fit every mold. For all the inspirations the game wears on its sleeve, it never rises above them, and thus feels like a title in search of an identity and desperate for a specific kind of player. It’s sometimes a good time, just not for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Creating a sequel to a 12-year-old game is never an easy task. Recapturing the magic of the original while implementing modern technology and design strategies can mangle the core values that made the original special. Dragon’s Dogma 2 never loses sight of its roots, and constantly finds big and small ways to surprise me even 50 hours in. At its core, Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures a sense of adventure. While you’re the center point of the conflict and strife in the world, Dragon's Dogma 2 isn’t afraid to make you feel small. Around every bend, it reminds you that you’re just one part of a larger whole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game doesn’t waste any time setting the stage for the political power struggles and the role you play in them. The main plot serves as your reason for adventuring, but it isn’t until the last roughly 15 hours that it takes some big swings and absolutely nails them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nqv1kVfkLG8" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The capital city of Vernworth, where you will spend large chunks of the game, is a bustling town with merchant stalls lining the streets, the affluent noble quarters and their gaudy homes, and the castle grounds guarded to the teeth. NPCs roam around, shop, and stumble into you with quests and smaller tasks for you to handle. It pushes the notion that people live their lives whether you’re around or not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the majority of this game is traveling outside the safety of the city walls and testing your mettle in the wild. Every adventure I set forth required me to think in novel ways about how I needed to prepare. I constantly juggled the weight of my pack versus the healing items and camping materials I would need to survive. Dragon’s Dogma 2 makes every step outside of the city walls a critical decision and one I loved making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vocations offer different classes for you to use in combat. While I spent most of my time as a Thief, which excels at scaling large monsters like Cyclops or Griffons, there’s plenty to choose from. The Sorcerer's slow, powerful magic casting is vastly different from the quick and deadly blade of the Mystic Spearhand. Dragon’s Dogma 2 invites experimentation, and you can choose from these Vocations at will, granted you’ve completed some of the questlines to unlock them.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/e504a974/dd2_-_brant.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/e2f0127c/dd2_warfarer_archistaff.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/c37d3337/dd2_-_golem.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/093b3ea8/dd2_warfarer_greatsword.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/a1cc11df/dd2_-_gryphon.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/2e532a72/dd2_-_vernwerth.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/d3605d81/dd2_beastren_warrior.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Combat is brutal, long, and can leave you and your party on your last leg. The further you stray from the village and the longer you stay out imposes incredible risk. However, it’s a risk I happily took and one that always felt like the reward was high enough, even if my party died trying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pawn system from the original game returns, allowing you to create your central party member, customize their looks, vocations, and even their attitude toward players. The new improvements to the system are smart and incentivize you to experiment with other players' Pawns. I constantly switched out Pawns at every Rift Stone I could to see the best party composition possible, and it made all of the difference in battle. Having a team of fighters allowed me to swiftly trounce monsters, even if it meant not having a healer and relying on potions on scavenged fruit. These constant small decisions feed into the game’s larger idea of player freedom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your Pawns are instrumental in taking down the gruesome foes of Dragon’s Dogma 2. Whether it’s the hulking nature of the Minotaur or the sharp and jagged claws of a Griffon, Dragon’s Dogma 2 revels in its spectacle, making every battle a nailbiter.&lt;br /&gt;
However, large-scale battles are where you will see the performance on consoles take a big hit. When I had multiple enemies on screen, and a pawn would cast a big spell, the frame rate would dip tremendously.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/881ac543/dd2_dragonsplague_pawn.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/9b1df46f/dd2_fighter_maister_lennart.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/8e172f8f/dd2_magick_archer.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/f4c724c2/dd2_mystic_spearhand.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/38f0850a/dd2_spearhand_maister_sigurd.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/19/79499529/dd2_trickster_maister_luz.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Map markers and icons are few and far between in Dragon’s Dogma 2. It often feels like you’re playing detective and leaning into the role-playing elements; having a eureka moment when uncovering clues about a person's whereabouts never gets old. On a few occasions, I wasn’t given enough information to deduce the location of an NPC or monster correctly. This dilemma led me on a wild goose chase that felt unearned and a little tedious, especially because there are few fast travel options, so every time you leave the city, you’re going to be gone for hours at a time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragon’s Dogma 2 captures the spirit of the original without sanding down the edges of what made it excellent. Its insistence on player exploration and discovery, coupled with an ending I will think about for the rest of the year, makes Dragon’s Dogma 2 a standout game and a worthy successor.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Unicorn Overlord Review - Tactical Superiority

      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Teen
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Draw from enough unique inspirations, and eventually, a game begins to feel entirely novel. That’s the sensation that emerges as you play Unicorn Overlord, Vanillaware’s vast fantasy adventure of tactics, strategy, and storytelling. I was consistently reminded of other systems and mechanics from prior genre releases, but the resulting combination felt consistently original and entertaining, even after many hours of battle and exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players control a young, exiled prince in a high fantasy world as he gradually gathers an army to take down an all-powerful empire. There’s a significant focus on story and character development from beginning to end. The fact that the plentiful “thees and thous” frame an especially trope-heavy and familiar plot doesn’t diminish the enjoyment. Instead, I was delighted by the confident and well-written dialogue and its willingness to embrace the fun of countless long-lost siblings, figures in disguise, and redemptive character arcs. By the end, some interesting choices let you shape the game’s outcome, but this isn’t a game of bold narrative surprises – simply well-told comfort-food fantasy antics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unicorn Overlord is awash in systems that govern your army’s advancement and improvement. Whether it’s equipment, honor, renown, gold, or character level, the primary goal is growing your army, promoting your combatants, expanding the potential size of each unit, and setting up a team that can triumph in the field. Everything works together admirably, and it’s great fun to tweak each small squad unit to create unstoppable combos of damage, defense, and healing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battles are an intriguing mix of real-time troop movement and small unit-to-unit skirmishes. By adjusting each character’s formation placement and tactical decision-making before a melee, you set them up for success. However, once an exchange begins, your role as commander is in the back seat; you can’t affect the outcome anymore – only watch as it plays out. As such, much of the gameplay is about clever unit placement, movement, use of items, and pre-battle powers. I enjoyed overseeing a large and diverse army of knights, witches, gryphon riders, and elven archers as they strode into a righteous rebellion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zFu7jAkdELY" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vanillaware’s attention to detail and high production value are on full display. The vast top-down overworld is stacked with detail and vibrant, illustrated backdrops. The score is grand and dramatic, accompanied by a tremendous bounty of memorable voice acting. Most notably, both story moments and unit battles unfold featuring the studio’s striking trademark art and animation style, which leverages exaggerated deformation of everything from weapons to character curves and musculature to accentuate the fantasy setting and tone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I consistently enjoyed my dozens of hours with Unicorn Overlord, the latter half of the game begins to show some cracks in the fun. Because you can preview the outcome of each battle (which is good), many players will eventually do what I did, and begin to skip the bombastic visuals of a given skirmish to get on with the larger battle. The thrill of those lavishly illustrated scenes sadly begins to lean toward tedium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the plentiful unit types you both recruit and face in battle are initially intriguing but eventually become extremely challenging to keep straight. Imagine a game of “Rock, Paper, Scissors” where you can throw any one of dozens of distinct hand signs, and you can see the dilemma. Tactical complexity is good, but I ultimately found keeping all the distinctions straight slowed down the pacing and sense of mastery rather than enhancing an already rich tactical simulation. Combine those two problems, and late-game battles can feel repetitive and muddled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even acknowledging those frustrations, I love the variety of encounters Unicorn Overlord presents and the seamless way so many interlocking game systems contribute to an overarching saga of magic and warfare. From beginning to end, the game feels crafted, balanced, and deep, without sacrificing approachability. Set aside preconceptions from the unusual name, and you’ll find an epic well worth exploring.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>WWE 2K24 Review – Another Strong Push
</title>

  <description>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    



      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/11/555e911c/wwe_2k24_ambulance_match_1.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="WWE 2K24 review" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
              &lt;b&gt;Reviewed on:&lt;/b&gt;
      PlayStation 5
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Platform:&lt;/b&gt;
      PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt;
      2K Games
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developer:&lt;/b&gt;
      Visual Concepts
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Teen
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;WWE 2K24 leverages WrestleMania’s impending 40-year milestone to celebrate the event, and it proves to be a party worth attending. Enjoyable additions and smart improvements bolster its steadily improving formula, making it the strongest in-ring outing since the series’ return.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2K24’s control scheme remains largely unchanged from 2K23 but boasts neat new mechanics, such as the trading blows mini-game. This gamification of the back-and-forth “boo/yay” punch trope adds a fun wrinkle to combat. Other well-worn in-ring moments to receive attention include setting up big dives onto a mob of opponents; I rarely use it, but it’s nice to have. That sentiment applies to the game’s new match types: Casket, Ambulance, and Special Guest Referee. I’m generally lukewarm on these stipulations in real life and I won’t be rushing to play them often here, but they’re replicated well. I especially like how Special Referee sports a meter that limits ref shenanigans to keep it from being totally one-sided should you face a crooked official. It also fosters strategic cheating for the player in stripes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A staggering roster of over 200 Superstars out of the box varies from pretty good to spot-on in the looker department. I also appreciate smaller presentational touches, such as having real-life referees like Charles Robinson and Jessika Carr appear for the first time. Regardless of whose boots you wear, playing 2K24 remains a largely good hands-on experience, even if some moves could stand to be less mechanically dense. Forgetting all of the offensive options at your disposal is easy, but a robust tutorial helps simplify this learning curve. Existing match stipulations remain entertaining whether playing alone or online, though the latter destination is, at publishing, a tricky proposition thanks to spotty connections.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vbiy2I5jt90" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Showcase mode allows players to relive iconic bouts throughout the first 39 WrestleManias. Taking into account wrestlers who can’t appear due to current employment in rival organizations or for being generally problematic, it’s a strong curation of matches. Corey Graves’ commentary during transitions to real footage adds a nice touch compared to last year’s silent cutscenes. I also love that button prompts for objectives now appear on-screen, reducing trips to the menu screen to figure out how to execute a specific maneuver. Showcases’ wacky finale isn’t quite as memorable as last year’s big twist, but the mode is an overall improvement over 2K23’s rendition and a great celebration of WrestleMania that inspires me to rewatch my favorite matches from the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual story-driven journeys of MyRise present more narrative forks stemming from pivotal decision-making moments. Whether you play an indie legend navigating the mainstream waters of WWE or build the credibility of a low-card act chaotically thrust into the World Title picture, I like how choices pack more meaningful engagement to their overall enjoyable tales. It’s delightfully silly at points, and I also like seeing characters and plot points from last year’s MyRise reappear here, adding a welcomed continuity to 2K’s alternate WWE universe. Thankfully, created characters and unlockables finally carry over into more modes, adding deeper returns to my investment in MyRise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/13/4ad84879/wwe_2k24_-_shawn_michaels_vs_razor_ramon.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/03/11/5f646921/wwe_2k24_myrise_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/22/af157cdd/wwe_2k24_bianca_belair.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/22/888ea4f1/wwe_2k24_asuka_crop.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/22/fdfcace6/wwe_2k24_dude_love_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/19/a2215627/wwe_2k24_rhea_ripley.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/19/fc18a53f/wwe_2k24_hulk_hogan_vs_andre.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;MyGM, a personal favorite destination, remains a good time bolstered by expanded match types, GMs, talent interactions, and other options. It also feels more strategic now that you can level up individual talent by placing them in certain matches and negotiate Superstar trades between brands each season. Although Universe mode is less my jam, I’m happy to see the giant sandbox sim get options such as Money in the Bank cash-ins and run-ins, plus more cutscenes that add to its TV-like presentation. The card-collecting-themed MyFaction has never been my cup of tea, and 2K24 doesn’t change this, but it’s nice to see it receive more depth in match types and competitive multiplayer options. The already stellar creation suite sports additional items to build the coolest – or silliest – Superstars, arenas, entrances, or championships you can concoct, but don’t expect any major changes to its reliable template. That last point applies to nearly all of 2K24’s offerings: good iterations of an established formula.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2K24 sees Visual Concepts layer on quality new bricks to WWE 2K’s strong foundation while sanding away some rough edges. The series has settled into an exceptional, if very familiar, blueprint, and I would love to see a bigger shake-up in the future, but the result offers the best package since the franchise returned in 2022. If you’re a curious fan who’s held off on jumping back into the digital ring, 2K24 is as good an argument as any to shake off the ring rust. For diehard enthusiasts, this year’s entry won’t bowl you over in the broad sense, but its incremental updates and continued polish make it a worthy contender for another year.&lt;/p&gt;

      Everyone
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p style="margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Coming off the success of Sonic Mania, the development team behind one of the best games in Sega’s storied series is back with an all-new franchise. Much like how the studio now known as Evening Star’s previous effort was a love letter to a bygone era of platforming, Penny’s Big Breakaway is a fond tribute to the 3D platformers of the late ‘90s. Evening Star clearly knows how to design a fantastic new entry in this well-worn genre, but some important issues drag down an otherwise strong game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:13px"&gt;As Penny, a street performer whose yo-yo is transformed by a cosmic entity, you must leap, swing, spin, and dash through more than 11 colorful, themed worlds of stages. Each world is more colorful than the last, complemented by an upbeat soundtrack full of catchy tracks to push the action forward. In moving through these levels, Penny’s Big Breakaway steps into the spotlight in a big way. With the help of her enhanced yo-yo, Penny can pull off satisfying movement-based combos. Once you master the basics, jumping into the air, swinging from her yo-yo, landing in a roll, and smoothly launching into another combo with a twirl feels fantastic. In combat, however, I struggled with accidentally sending Penny flying off a cliff since double-tapping the attack button also initiates a dash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0NBFkCQamU" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Thankfully, combat is only a small piece of the overall pie, and from the moment the movement mechanics clicked with me to the moment I watched the credits roll, I adored building momentum as I sped through the stages. Those terrific moves are accentuated by top-tier level design. Evening Star provides players with a ton of expertly designed courses that play into Penny’s abilities. Penny’s Big Breakaway is at its best when you’re moving quickly through obstacle courses, and the levels give you plenty of opportunities to do so; even the optional side objectives often require you to complete the given task within a time limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:13px"&gt;I relished every twisting path that let me quickly roll through, but I also enjoyed exploring every corner I could to find the collectibles used to purchase extra-challenging bonus stages. Levels typically offer branching pathways, and I loved trying to find the best route through the stages, though the fixed camera sometimes discouraged me from poking around too much. I was also disappointed by how many times I clipped through a stage element and had to restart from a checkpoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Sadly, the entire experience is brought down by a problem many early 3D platformers struggled with: depth perception. By the time I beat the story mode, I had lost count of the number of times I missed a seemingly easy jump because I couldn’t tell where Penny was in relation to the platform I was trying to land on. While the obvious answer is to look at her shadow’s position on the platform, my brain constantly needed to perform the calculus of whether Penny was where she looked like she was or where the game said she was. Unfortunately, this permeates the entire experience, poisoning the well of the overall gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:13px"&gt;A smaller issue that often rears its ugly head is that of screen-crowding. One of the key elements Penny’s Big Breakaway uses to propel the player forward is a group of penguins that swarm you in a capture attempt. Each time this happens, it immediately raises the level of on-screen chaos, but it sometimes goes too far as the penguins obscure everything happening in the level. Add to that an intrusive U.I. element that pops up when you’re near a side mission, and on multiple occasions, I had to blindly perform a leap of faith and hope for the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:13px"&gt;It’s a shame so many problems weigh on this otherwise enjoyable adventure. Even with the screen-crowding, bugs, and depth-perception troubles, I still look back fondly on the superb level design and movement mechanics. But because of those important detractors, Penny’s Big Breakaway lands as a solid 3D platformer unable to swing to the great heights it felt destined for.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Balatro Review – A Winning Hand

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;I’m not a poker player. I’ve never learned the game, and my limited knowledge of it largely stems from pop culture osmosis, such as James Bond films and referential quips from X-Men’s Gambit. I couldn’t tell you what makes a Royal Flush, but I know it’s good to have it. Despite its premise and appearance, Balatro technically isn’t poker. It is, however, the first title to make me understand and enjoy the core premise of the card game. It also happens to be one of the most engrossing games of the year.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Calling Balatro a poker game would be disingenuous. You don’t even play against other opponents. It’s actually a poker-inspired roguelike deckbuilder. Over a series of rounds, you’re tasked with playing the best hand possible to score a minimum number of chips to advance to the next round. You begin with a standard 52-card deck and only draw four hands (with limited discards) to fulfill this score criteria. The most prominent poker element is learning how to assemble various types of hands, such as a Flush, Straight, or Full House. Thankfully, a helpful glossary illustrating what each type of hand looks like and their score values is just a button click away. This simple and accessible reference has allowed me to memorize poker hands for the first time, expediting my enjoyment of Balatro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgrv9giaNO8" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Three Blinds (basically rounds) make up an Ante, and you win a game by completing eight Antes. Lose a round, and you start from the first Ante. Balatro would be enjoyable if it simply consisted of this straightforward premise, but the magic comes in how it incorporates the roguelike genre’s satisfying power climb. You earn cash based on your performance each round, which in turn is used to purchase a variety of cards from booster packs with wacky abilities to augment your deck. Equipping up to five Joker cards, of which over 100 types exist, bestows passive effects or trigger abilities. Some add score multipliers for playing certain suits or bonus chips for not playing a face card. One of my favorites is a glitched Joker that multiplies my score by a random amount, adding a fun roulette element. Jokers dramatically alter the game in a plethora of neat ways, but it doesn’t stop there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using consumables, such as Tarot, Planet, and Spectral cards, raise the score value of certain hand types, add more special effects to cards, and more. Other examples include transforming cards into gold or steel variants that reward chips or cash the longer they stay in your hand. Glass cards have a chance to shatter permanently when played but boast a score multiplier. I love weighing the benefits and downsides of every ability and how they enhance or change my existing lineup. I’m constantly evolving my strategy, even when I settle into a winning formula. Balatro never overwhelms players with too many options at once, and your strength grows at a steady pace. I also appreciate how these mechanics add whimsy and absurdity to a card game I usually associate with blank staring and financial ruin.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result is a wildly fun roguelike that’s hard to put down. With so many combinations of loadouts, discovering new Jokers and other cards leads to thrilling experimentation. Many effects complement each other, sometimes in unexpected ways, allowing for a variety of strategies I’m still uncovering. Balatro’s flexibility lets players try many different deckbuilding styles, whether you build a deck consisting of one or two suits or one that emphasizes face cards. I once made a deck that facilitated creating high-scoring straight flushes as often as possible. Everything feels viable with the right skill and luck.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/28/9b291548/balatro_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/28/eb86734e/balatro_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/28/98dbcb72/balatro_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/28/491299ec/balatro_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Balatro is almost Vampire Survivors-esque in its satisfying escalation from playing small hands for decent points to setting off several card effects in succession as multipliers rise to the hundreds, causing your score meter to catch fire NBA Jam-style. I love that building a good deck/loadout can earn me thousands of points for playing a simple Pair. Everything works together to provide constant dopamine hits. Plus, playing well and trying new cards unlocks additional decks (each with unique, beneficial traits) along with new Jokers, booster packs, and more. This mechanic incentivizes me to try out cards I was initially skeptical about, and I discover new favorites while filling an in-game database of every available card in the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Completing Antes becomes progressively more challenging, especially since every third round presents a Boss Blind that saddles you with a single, debilitating effect. Perhaps diamond cards are useless, or you can only play one type of hand. More devilish boss blinds require you to win with a single hand or nullify the value/effects of every card you’ve used during the round. As tough as they can be, I enjoyed how these bouts made Balatro feel even more puzzle-like and forced me to find new solutions instead of banking on reliable tactics. Boss Blinds are randomized, limiting how much you can plan ahead, sometimes leading to devastating defeats when a boss’ stipulation perfectly counters your strategies. Losses mean starting from scratch, and as much as that often stings, I usually restart a new run immediately. Balatro’s “one more run” hook is powerful, and I’m still surprised how much time melts away while playing.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balatro’s other cool feature allows you to save runs, called seeds, that can be replayed or shared with others. Playing another player's seed tailors your run to match theirs, meaning you’ll encounter whatever shop and item combinations they discovered at the expense of disabling new unlocks/discoveries. In addition to shaking things up, seeds add an enjoyable social element to the game, as players can share seeds to help others beat the game and uncover rarer cards. Tack on various challenges, and Balatro dangles plenty of carrots to keep players engaged in the long run.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Balatro is an ingenious and entertaining roguelike and one of my favorite games of the year. Playing it has become a near-obsession; everything feels perfectly designed to encourage you to keep trying because that next run could be the run of your life. Even after hours of play, I still can’t overcome Balatro’s biggest challenge: putting it down.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p style="margin-top:16px"&gt;Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has quite the act to follow up – it must both live up to the sky-high expectations set by its predecessor, Final Fantasy VII Remake, and synthesize and modernize perhaps the most crucial chapter in our heroes' adventure across Gaia. While my 80 hours in Rebirth didn't quite match the overall nirvana of Remake, it's a game I struggled to put down. A few stumbling blocks, like a bloated and sometimes tedious open world and intermittently uneven pacing, threaten the highs of Rebirth. But an exciting and well-told story, with an awe-inspiring finale to boot, almost made me forget the lows. The final result is a flawed but deeply reverent love letter to one of gaming's most beloved RPGs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally out of Midgar, Cloud, Aerith, Tifa, Barret, and Red XIII embark on a continent-hopping journey to stop Sephiroth from executing his plan to destroy the planet, starting with a visit to the city of Kalm. Like Midgar before, Kalm is lovingly recreated from polygonal pathways into a fully realized town. Seeing such a familiar location through the lens of 2024 for the first time is a treat, and it's a feeling carried throughout the entire game. Junon, Cosmo Canyon, Nibelheim – iconic locations burned into my brain deliver moments of awe with each visit, and the feeling never gets old. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/ed036af6/nibelheimi_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/e57686f9/nibelheim.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/47ce97b6/kalm.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/aea3a885/junon_city.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/f50b81fb/costa_del_sol_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/c64e777f/gongaga.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/9e5f89b1/cosmo_canyon.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/6d649a46/cid_key_art.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, though, asset pop-in in larger areas and unnaturally harsh lighting changes when going from inside to outside distract from that awe. And the game's performance mode, which seems to run at a stable 60 FPS, is so blurry that I stuck with the 30 FPS graphics mode. A recent patch mitigated these issues a bit, but they still persist. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surrounding each of these locations is a sprawling open area dotted with side quests, combat challenges, card game matches, treasure caches, intel towers, scavenger hunts, and more. While exciting at first, realizing that each open-world area in Rebirth consists of the same objectives grew more disappointing as time passed. Much of it is good fun, carried by excellent combat and strong connections to the world and lore of Final Fantasy VII, but more variety would have gone a long way to sprucing up my time outside of story content. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/cc8a54f0/corel_resort_area.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/71fa8372/summon_materia.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/5b9c0122/summon_shrine.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/6077989f/chocobo_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/59bbed3f/protorelic_g.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/f3c057bd/chocobo_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/9b219fab/junon_hunt.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/5670acd2/chocobo.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Pockets of greatness, like the fantastic Queen's Blood card game or special Summon Shrines that lead to new powerful materia, are still great even when repeated throughout the world map. And where the standard area objectives rarely stray from the formula established early on, the side quests, which range from fine and forgettable to great, sprinkled throughout each region, provide levity and a nice touch of weirdness to the world of Cloud and his friends. One even had me laughing out loud at my screen, reeling from a reality check delivered right to Red XIII. Traversing these lands can be tedious at times, especially in areas where specific Chocobo mechanics, like mushroom-hopping and wind gliding, are required, and my frustrations with Rebirth's overfilled open world peaked in these moments. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But old and new story beats, like Bugenhagen's explanation of the lifestream and the return of familiar faces from Final Fantasy VII Crisis Core, pulled me out of those dumps. Some of my favorite original Final Fantasy VII moments are given new life with beautiful visuals and expanded exposition. Fighting new foes and classic bosses with Rebirth's combat, which further builds on Remake's real-time action-strategy system, is exhilarating. Additional party members, like Red XIII, Yuffie, and Cait Sith, inject new layers of defensiveness, speed, and whimsy, respectively, to the mix, and Rebirth smartly uses the weapon proficiency bonus system and story moments to ensure none are left sitting on the bench for too long. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/475cc5e1/outside_junon.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/afe86cb9/sunset_costa_del_sol.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/3c734fd2/opener.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/d6a03dd5/nibelheim_opener5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/dd010e29/bugenhagen.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Square Enix nails almost every story beat, expanding on the lore in ways I didn't know I wanted while remaining faithful to the original narrative, but falters a few times with needlessly overstuffed chapters. One, in particular, begins with the endorphin rush of the Gold Saucer and then dumps you into a literal dustbowl with a laundry list of boring quests to complete before allowing you to continue forward, bringing the fun to an excruciating halt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Remake is about showing how the capitalist, villainous Shinra Electric Power Company is destroying Midgar, Rebirth is about how this company is destroying the world. Square Enix uses the game's various regions to demonstrate Shinra's effects on the planet and its people up close and personal. The Gold Saucer shines bright at night, with nearly a dozen minigames – just a fraction of the total game's shocking amount –  and collectible treasures for its patrons (and Cloud) to delight in. But the surrounding Corel region is in ruins, now a desert thanks to miniature reactors converting the region's lifestream into the energy needed to power the nightlife resort. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/13c6f89d/gold_saucer_minigame.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/d212d95b/protorelic_minigame_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/55b8c612/frog_sidequest_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Cloud's fight to catch and stop Sephiroth takes a backseat to this commentary throughout, giving them time to work through their emotions together as most are venturing beyond where they've ever been in this world. Those discussions and growing bonds weave in and out of combat, where new Synergy Abilities provide meaningful boosts to Rebirth's action in various ways, like one that splits two Active Time Battle bars into three or another that massively increases an enemy's stagger. These abilities and other skills directly improve Cloud's standing with his party, opening opportunities for additional insight and raising a special relationship meter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sephiroth's sparse screentime makes each appearance by the One-Winged Angel all the more terrifying, culminating in a final act that broke my mind in the best way, both as a test of my combat abilities and my understanding of Final Fantasy VII. Square Enix already made clear to players where this game comes to a close, but the finale, which best serves fans rather than first-time players, isn't any less wondrous because of that. Rebirth's score matches the heights of this closing act and the rest of the game, with gorgeous tear-inducing arrangements, jazz-fusion bops, and an eclectic mix of new songs and old favorites.  &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/431d24f2/cloud_and_seph.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/d7880f7b/synergy_ability.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/9d3127d6/relationship_change.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/a0ea618d/shinra_rufus_president.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/21/cad8e6db/junon.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;This sequel went wide, and while that comes with benefits, like new ways to explore this beloved world and its various sights, it also comes with drawbacks. They aren't unlike anything fans of the genre have experienced before, and playing as cherished characters certainly eases the pain, but the tedium and bloat of the open-world checklist can sometimes get in the way of where Rebirth truly shines. The best of Remake exists in Rebirth, but the various open-world areas surrounding it – the parts that make Rebirth unique from its predecessor – sometimes miss the mark.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;Like a ship that has changed tack countless times and delayed its arrival at port, Skull and Bones has launched far later than expected and faced trouble along the way. Even so, this pirate adventure surprised me with the breadth of its world, the richness of its commerce simulation, and an approachable and rewarding naval combat system. As a living game built around seasonal content and a growing universe, it has a ways to go to be at its best, but the bones of a quality experience are here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a treasure-hungry pirate eager for infamy as you set out across the Indian Ocean, tracking down treasure chests, plundering seaside towns, and, most prominently, battling other ships on the high seas. On-foot activity is reserved for social spaces and the most minimal of story development – the entirety of action unfolds on the water, where you develop an impressive array of ships and weaponry through your ill-gotten gains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Launching where the maritime voyages of the Assassin’s Creed games left off, I enjoyed the deliberate pacing of sea exploration and movement, punctuated by the regular interruption of cannon fire and mortars. Especially in the early hours, I was often transfixed by the sights and sounds of moving across the water, listening to my crew’s sea shanties, watching for breaching whales, and using my spyglass to spot distant shipwrecks. It’s a big and beautifully crafted world of island-rich open waters and tricky narrow riverways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat has just enough complexity to remain entertaining as you balance turning speed, facing, and aiming to maximize damage output while dodging or bracing against the worst attacks of your opponents. The real fun comes from building and tweaking your boat as an engine of destruction; the variety of ship builds and approaches to fighting kept me consistently interested in chasing that next upgrade. I appreciated the approach to tracking specific items and upgrades, with clear markings on the map for where to find what you want. Because of that, it becomes about whether you have enough money to buy something or a powerful enough ship to take it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bulk of play is PvE encounters against privateers, merchants, and corporation ships, played either solo or cooperatively. Even if the open servers allow for both structured and informal PvP, my anecdotal experience was that most players were focused on their own adventures. If they joined a battle, it was often to help out. Your mileage may vary, but I liked the mix of mostly campaign-style progression with the option to connect with other players when I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmDYo7MbQxo" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond ramming and blowing up other ships, Skull and Bones’ other core pillar is commerce. Ubisoft has built a robust trading system, the most lucrative of which involves illicit rum and opium shipments. I appreciated how the game allows players to choose how much they want to engage here. The selling of commodities gathered from sunken ships is the most superficial layer, but you can also run your own manufacturing and delivery contracts for higher sums. And as you round the corner into the endgame, an entire kingpin empire opens up, letting you take over lumberyards and other factories to generate income passively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pirate life eventually wears out its welcome; many of the game’s most significant problems only arise after many hours of play. While it's fun in the early hours getting your bearings in an unfamiliar sea, later side and main missions become painfully repetitive. Long ocean voyages start to lose their charm, and a fast travel system that only works from port feels increasingly restrictive since you’re often eager to return to a mission giver to keep the action moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The freeform progression that was so welcome in the early hours also causes problems over time, as it’s too easy to be over- or under-leveled for certain content you might wish to confront, robbing many encounters of tension since the winning party is so evident from the outset.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The storytelling is incredibly sparse, led by very few core contacts, all of whose arcs are pretty one-note. And while it’s nice that you can customize the look of your pirate captain, their voiceless absence of personality feels especially ill-suited to the big personalities you expect in a classic pirate tale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, the combination of building a commerce empire, sea monster hunts, engaging in late-game PvE and PvP events, and the chance to continue tweaking and building your ideal pirate ship has appeal even after the core story missions wrap up, giving me hope that longterm endgame could be entertaining. And while it’s early days, I saw potential in the larger ship team-up activities I tried out, where each ship takes on specific roles like you might see in an MMO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its long and circuitous course to arrive at port, Skull and Bones is the type of game that may change significantly in the coming months. But to evaluate it as it stands, fellow pirate enthusiasts may discover what I did – a flawed but beautifully presented historical fantasy in which one can take to the water and make a fortune, even if absolutely everything about the pirate life isn’t always pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

      Mature
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Nearly 10 years on from 2015's Helldivers, Helldivers 2 carefully adapts the simple yet exciting formula of bug-blasting with buddies for a modern audience. Arrowhead Game Studios has swapped the top-down perspective for third-person while maintaining the frenetic, ballistic loop of crash-landing on hostile planets, completing difficult missions, and extracting against all odds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a galaxy torn apart by war, you and your friends are Helldivers, the brainwashed protectors of Super Earth, invigorated by humorous trite aphorisms espousing patriotism and the importance of so-called democracy. Invading forces of menacing Automatons and craggy, organic Terminids threaten your way of life and have made their home on precious interstellar real estate. After earning the shining cape of “freedom” in the game's boot camp tutorial, you are set loose to tackle an impressive variety of punchy missions. Your objectives range from simple hive exterminations to complicated launch code recovery missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the exciting unpredictability of Helldivers 2 is secretly the game's best feature. Whether it's challenging terrain, wounded limbs, inclement weather, or a miscommunicated orbital strike that brutalizes your entire squad, your best-laid plans are destined to fall apart in devastating, hilarious fashion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oD3pxbG9YYI" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat in Helldivers 2 is all meat, no gristle. The movement feels fluid and reactive, whether you're sprinting to safety or comically leaping into prone to dodge the chainsaw arm of a lurching terminator. This means while you encounter similar biomes and objectives, the journey to meet your goals is always fraught with wonderful chaos. One great benefit to this system is Stratagems – abilities that can be accessed in combat by quickly inputting a sequence of D-pad button presses, like a Mortal Kombat Fatality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After playing finger DDR, you're given a marker grenade to revive your teammates, resupply and call down offensive airstrikes, top-tier weaponry, minefields, and more. Getting the inputs wrong as bugs nip at your health induces a feverish cocktail of adrenaline and fear. However, when you do smash it in successfully and summon a shower of hellfire, saving your gunned-down compatriots, the heroism is intoxicating. Few games provide such powerful opportunities to play the hero as Helldivers 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The efficacy of each snappy run is dependent on who makes it off the planet and how many optional objectives you complete. Subsequently, this determines the XP, Requisition, Samples, and Medals you take home, an uncomplicated suite of resources used to develop your ship and purchase new weaponry, armor, and Stratagems. Helldivers 2 also offers free and premium battle passes and a Superstore where players can use a premium currency called 'Super Credits.' Thankfully, the paid content isn't overly intrusive and can easily be avoided as you progress through the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/19/e5df5283/helldivers2_screenshot_8.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/19/8029d7e1/helldivers2_screenshot_19.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/19/b56af551/hd2_sep23_screen_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/19/1990b924/hd2_sep23_screen_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/19/58bb6a85/hd2_sep23_screen_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/19/62258ba7/hd2_sep23_screen_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Helldivers 2's customizable kit makes it easy to specialize within teams; are you the ammo-carrying support act or the pyromaniac frontman dousing the battlefield in flames?&amp;nbsp; Despite my efforts, I was my team's problem child, flush with airstrikes and mines that negotiated as many spectacular escapes as they did squad wipes. There's nothing quite as humbling (or humorous) as stumbling into your own minefield during a desperate sprint to the shuttle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond its refreshingly straightforward feedback loop, even more enthralling is how your personal success impacts the overall narrative. Helldivers 2 operates on a live map, with players around the world slowly liberating quadrants of planets, their actions influenced by Major Orders passed down by central control. In an already collaborative game, this compounds the sense of community, making you feel like you're part of something bigger than even the heady emotional beats of your squad's missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest hurdle Helldivers 2 has to face is its own success; servers have been overrun since launch, leading to lengthy wait times and faltering progression systems. Yet, for me, the indoctrination is just too strong. I'm still compelled to wait my turn to get another taste of sweet victory in this live-service diamond in the rough.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Mario Vs. Donkey Kong Review - The Rivalry Lives On

  <description>
                                    



      &lt;p&gt;&lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/13/8b5a3d3b/co_op_mvd.jpg" width="800" height="450" alt="" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      Switch
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A developer can take many different approaches when remaking a game, but its primary goal always remains the same: to create a new experience that honors the spirit of the original. With Mario vs Donkey Kong, a remake of the 2004 Game Boy Advance title of the same name, Nintendo succeeds in this goal. By combining new worlds and modern quality-of-life features with the game's classic, delightful puzzle design, Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a strong start to Nintendo's 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;In the game's opening, Donkey Kong raids a toy factory where they make Mini Marios, the hottest new product on the market. To get them back, Mario must chase him down through eight worlds, each with two distinct halves. In the first chunk, he has to carry a key to a locked door, and in the second, he has to reach the Mini Mario located somewhere in the level. On paper, it runs the risk of becoming repetitive, but in practice, there's so much variety from level to level that I was never bored. With only six standard levels in each world, there's a lot of room to play with mechanics and level design, and I was constantly impressed with how the game kept me engaged. It's nothing revolutionary – these are still puzzles from 20 years ago – but they hold up better than many games from the same year.&lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/29/851f61ad/img_0959.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;The element of the game that I enjoyed the most was Mario's versatility of movement. Between handstands, pivot jumps, and triple jumps, it's a blast to move from one side of the stage to another. They're necessary techniques in later levels, but early on, you can become the master of the space and skip entire sections if you know what you're doing. Combining this with its intuitive puzzle design, Mario vs. Donkey Kong makes players feel smart and skilled even when the puzzles are relatively straightforward. Triple jumping out of a handstand over an enemy through the final collectible present and into the end of the level is thrilling every time you pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;The game makes up for its age with a number of new features, my favorite of which is a "casual mode." When activated, Mario no longer resets the level when he dies. Instead, he has a limited number of bubbles that he can use to respawn at nearby checkpoints upon taking damage.  It opens the game to younger players or anyone who might get stuck more easily. The puzzles don't get any less challenging, but the platforming becomes more forgiving, which makes the game less frustrating, especially in some tough-as-nails postgame levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;This remake also adds two new worlds: Merry Mini-Land and Slippery Summit. While I found them to be a tad easier than the existing levels, they fit the style of the other stages well, and they're welcome additions that slightly extend what was previously a short game. After beating the game, you also unlock a Time Attack mode for every completed level, adding a new challenge for willing players. Add on the + worlds (harder versions of all eight base worlds) and a series of expert stages, and the game has a healthy amount of content if you're willing to dive in. Completing the plus worlds was enough of a challenge for me, but I was glad to know there was more to play if the mood struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:13px; margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Mario vs. Donkey Kong is a simple game, but as is the case with Mario's best titles, there's an elegance to that simplicity. Nintendo has done a stellar job adding features to make it more palatable to a modern audience, but it only comes together because of how well the classic levels hold up. Mario and Donkey Kong have been rivals for over 40 years, and this game admirably carries that legacy forward.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Mature
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;Years ago, when I first heard about the provocative title for Rocksteady’s follow-up to the Arkham games, I recall wondering what mental gymnastics were in store to not actually murder the well-liked central characters of the DC mythos, including the version of Batman the studio had so expertly developed over prior titles. Credit where it’s due: Rocksteady followed through, and Kill the Justice League does just that. Unfortunately, it also killed my interest or enthusiasm through a story that feels juvenile and callous alongside repetitive and confusing gameplay. While many technical features work as intended, I walked away from every session feeling angry and out of sorts, which aren’t sensations that will keep me returning for endless hours of future adventures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suicide Squad is a high-octane action shooter where rapid urban traversal and uproarious gun combat are your non-stop companions. A ragtag crew of criminals, including Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark, must fight through the devastated city of Metropolis, gradually offing the heroes of Earth after they’ve been brainwashed by the villain, Brainiac. Each of the four characters has their variation in how they fling themselves across the city and an upgrade path that allows for some specialization. Still, the core idea is pulling triggers, throwing grenades, and bashing into alien invaders. Each acrobatic navigation style takes some time to master, but I ultimately enjoyed the sense of speed and mobility. In combat, however, the constant vertical up-and-down effect is the first of many issues that make it hard to track what’s happening.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By default, an incredibly crowded HUD is almost nonsensically busy; the biggest challenge of important fights wasn’t the battle itself but simply seeing what was happening and where certain enemies or objectives were. The HUD may be customized and minimized, but you’re left with the opposite problem and too little information to complete tasks. Enemies have some functional variety but lack visual distinctiveness, adding to a pervasive sense of monotony where all the mission types bleed together into one chaotic smashfest. Everything is loud and obnoxious but rarely exciting.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/05/1aa1910d/screen-01.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/05/99ac9308/screen-02.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/05/23f305cd/screen-04.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/02/05/0253fd1c/screen-05.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Frequent cutscenes exhibit excellent animation and artwork on characters, especially showcasing some emotive facial expressions. Even with that advantage, the storytelling fails on numerous levels. It’s hard to enjoy a story where I don’t like anybody, and even the anti-heroes and bad guys are endlessly spouting bad one-liners, trash-talking, and shouting at each other. Beyond that tonal disconnect, the narrative is weirdly inconsistent and hard to parse, often with the leads feeling almost like side characters in their own story, with little volition of their own.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Progress through the game involves gear and character improvement by completing side missions; many tasks set overly specific requirements that rob the combat of variety, like only critical hits or certain types of melees to do damage. The more crafted main missions (especially the ones to take out League members) are more attractive, but are, without exception, weirdly anti-climactic and end with such bleak death scenes that any potential humor is blunted.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Online cooperative play works well. Especially after the short campaign’s conclusion, four friends could have a good time leaping and swinging around the city, blowing up bad guys in repetitive but action-packed missions. Unfortunately, I never warmed to the player investment loop. Many character upgrades are invisible beyond changes to things like the percentage of damage dealt or how long a power might last. Gear is more compelling, with some unique effects on the best weapons, but it all starts to feel the same after several hours.&amp;nbsp;Post-campaign rewards and activities make a fervent effort to keep players engaged, but I found most to be new window dressing on existing mission types I had already confronted many times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Suicide Squad is technically sound, and the action can be fast, frantic, and occasionally fun. The game could be considered a deconstruction and satirizing of the superhero concept. But for me, the whole thing feels mean-spirited, pessimistic, and glib. In other media, I’ve generally liked the irreverence of the Suicide Squad tales, but everything in this game feels less about laughs and more just joyless. I suppose it can be fun to piss all over any sense of genuine heroism in a comic book-inspired tale, but it can’t come as a great shock when some fans like myself just aren’t interested in the bloody and smug results.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Granblue Fantasy: Relink Review - The Borders Of The Skies
</title>

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The thrill of adventure in a boundless playground tickles the imagination, something intimately familiar to players of Granblue Fantasy, a mobile/browser-based title that has been a hit internationally for over a decade. The original title resembles 16-bit turn-based RPGs like the Final Fantasy or Dragon Quest games of old, leaving daydreams of grander scale and exploits a hopeful wish rather than an inevitable reality. With Granblue Fantasy: Relink, developer CyGames has an opportunity to explore a fantasy world of open skies and magic while pulling the game from a comparatively modest mobile title into a full-blown 3D action game. While not completely successful, Granblue Fantasy: Relink should be lauded for getting most of the way to being a memorable title, but it needed a little more ambition and unique content to reach that goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relink guides players through a single-player campaign with the crew of the &lt;em&gt;Grandcypher,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;a band of skyfarers that has combat-resolved adventures on every new island it comes across. For this title, a wholly original island and story was created, tasking the crew with rescuing one of their own by defeating giant monsters called Primal Beasts and defeating a sorceress controlling them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those unfamiliar with the story and characters of Granblue Fantasy will not find Relink particularly interested in catching the player up. Small vignettes of how the characters met and how they arrived at the latest pitstop island that sets up this game’s adventures are essentially all the player receives without the aid of fanmade wikis filling in the rest. It has a similar energy to picking up the anime &lt;em&gt;One Piece&lt;/em&gt; halfway through or jumping into the middle of a Tales game, with no intention or desire to dwell on its past history the player is presumed to have seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hg2wKVsGTL8" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Relink can also look beautiful, especially with its painterly environments, but it is difficult not to notice that the art style translates inconsistently among the characters. Arc System Works’ Granblue Fantasy Versus is a much more successful experiment using the same designs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The single-player campaign, while short, presents interesting plights like climbing toward a wind god at the top of a blustery mountain or taking back a castle from an invading force. Players take control of an unlockable cast of 19 characters with different fighting styles and special moves to follow a somewhat basic storyline that does not take too many big or unpredictable swings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These characters all share a similar template of using four special moves and movement options, but they vary significantly in special skills and meters. My favorite character bounced on top of enemies and specialized in parries on the ground, but a late unlock focused more on transformations and building up meter, making even just those two feel distinct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, levels are largely linear pathways without much in the way of exploration. The endless skies and hovering islands are rarely used for anything but backgrounds and transference to the next fight, leaving little reason to poke your nose anywhere but the most linear path. A world where the characters talk about inexhaustible space for escapades and capers but spend much of their time in caves and on walkways is incongruent in a way that grates as time goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/30/5492bb58/01_relink_preorder_20230808.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/30/a55f2648/02_relink_preorder_20230808.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/30/6a8a540d/04_relink_preorder_20230808.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/30/0d26db9b/05_relink_preorder_20230808.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/30/d21f5e06/06_relink_preorder_20230808.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;After completing the single-player campaign, players can take combat quests that can be played co-op with friends or strangers. Difficulty rises alongside progressing ranks, and characters must power up through elective means like skill trees and weapons to keep up. By endgame, keeping a team powerful enough to solo these missions requires a lot of grinding, but focusing on one character discourages variety, especially when there is the option of 18 others to use. There is no real way to work around this grind, which wants you to redo missions over and over to get admittedly guaranteed materials and experience to upgrade, though the reversal from how smooth the early game’s progress felt can act as a frustrating brick wall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Endgame bosses are monstrous with equally gargantuan HP bars, making battles tedious. Unlike a Monster Hunter, your quarry never escapes or requires different strategies, and the likelihood of powering through any knock-out state means the player is mainly in a race against ending the battle before getting bored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The saving grace of these extended gameplay encounters is that the combat is reasonably engaging, and interactions between characters will likely delight existing Granblue Fantasy fans. Relink is unlikely to be any newcomer’s favorite game. Still, the basic gameplay is fun and keeps you moving along the treadmill, especially if you have a gathering of like-minded source material fans to help you slay its biggest figurative and literal dragons.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Persona 3 Reload Review - Into The Light

      &lt;p style="margin-bottom:13px"&gt;Persona 3 is perhaps the most important entry in the Shin Megami Tensei spin-off franchise. By establishing several series mainstays, including the popular Social Links system, Persona 3 laid the foundation upon which the next two mainline entries would be built. Unfortunately, by today’s standards, that 18-year-old title is unapproachable in many ways. Persona 3 Reload remedies that, bringing forward the outstanding cast, story, and turn-based battles in a faithful remake with the modern amenities of Persona 5 Royal. While it is a massive success, some persistent outdated elements from the original prevent Reload from reaching the heights of other modern games in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a premise familiar to Persona fans, you control a transfer student arriving at his new high school. However, when night falls, it’s far from an ordinary schoolkid’s existence as you enter an anomaly known as the Dark Hour. Here, everyone is confined to coffins except for powerful humans who can wield magical entities known as Personas. Using these, the cast must hunt down Shadows around the city, primarily in a procedurally generated tower known as Tartarus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love exploiting the combat system’s many quirks en route to victory. Landing a critical hit with one character before shifting to another to hit an elemental weakness, then polishing the foes off with a powerful All-Out Attack, is ceaselessly thrilling. Being able to directly control all characters in your party is a no-brainer by today’s standards and a huge quality-of-life improvement over the original base game. In fact, nearly all the innovations from Persona 5 are present, and the addition of the Theurgy system diversified my combat strategies in fun ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4py4V5xwXWE" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theurgies are powerful, cinematic ultimate abilities that charge over the course of battle. Since each character’s meter charges (and each ability provides different effects), I often went out of my way to perform the character-specific actions – whether that be healing, summoning Personas, or attacking with physical abilities – during battles with lesser enemies. Entering a tough battle with a full party of charged meters always gave me a boost of confidence, even if they were far from instant-win buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The battles are as exciting as the series has ever seen, but one key improvement from Persona 5 didn’t make it into this remake: handcrafted dungeons. Even with this version’s addition of Monad Doors that house powerful minibosses and special rewards, the randomly generated floors of Tartarus serving as the game’s main dungeon feel outdated. After hours of dungeon-crawling, the experience can become monotonous when you’re climbing through hundreds of generic floors full of the same monsters. Thankfully, the boss battles and sequences leading up to them are as compelling as ever, delivering the best combat in the game and often revealing my favorite character moments in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of characters, the excellent cast of Persona 3 is allowed to shine brighter than ever through additional voice acting and more social scenes. I loved balancing the social elements of a typical high school experience with the extraordinary circumstances presented to my protagonist. However, I am disappointed that the female protagonist option included in Persona 3 Portable is neither present nor the added epilogue from FES. In a modern remake arriving decades later, it’s unfortunate to have content missing from older re-releases.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/d46bf083/6-18_combat_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/54336b3e/6-13_combat_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/bc15c49f/p3r_6-12_mysterious_boy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/edeed568/p3r_6-13_aoa.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/75b12d02/p3r_6-13_shift.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/50de18ba/6-13_combat_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/0b8872f1/p3r_6-13_velvet_room.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/3cf79809/6-18_combat_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/2724d1d1/p3r_6-14_crane_game.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/a1f1bbf2/p3r_6-15_arcade.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/69681476/p3r_6-16_dorm_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/7b537d20/p3r_6-16_dorm.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/ba3635d4/6-13_combat_7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/a4fdc084/p3r_6-18_mall.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/12/814f31a3/protagonist_aoa.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Due to modernized and expanded Social Links, I truly felt I got to know many of the supporting characters better. I became emotionally invested in stories involving a motivated track athlete pushing through an injury to inspire a younger family member, an elderly couple coping with the loss of their son, and a young girl struggling amidst her parents’ divorce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forming bonds with these characters grants boosts for certain Persona fusions, but I primarily pursued the Links to further unravel the narrative threads. Later, you can also form closer bonds with your party members, but even before that, you can awaken new abilities within your team by cooking, gardening, or watching movies with them at the dorm. Though stilted, repetitive animations sometimes took me out of the moment, Persona 3 Reload’s emotional beats hit hard as the themes of death and loss resonate throughout this long story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even after nearly 100 hours, I was sad to part ways with my team, feeling as though I had formed bonds with them that transcend any kind of in-game Social Link metric. Even with some outdated and repetitive elements inherited through the 18-year-old structure of the original, Persona 3 Reload is one of the best entries in one of the most acclaimed modern role-playing franchises in video games.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;By the time I saw the credits on &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth"&gt;Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&lt;/a&gt;, I felt like I had been through the emotional ringer. I was mentally exhausted. I think that's by design. Infinite Wealth is developer &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/11/24/the-future-of-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio"&gt;Ryu Ga Gotoku's&lt;/a&gt; (RGG) most ambitious project by a long shot – an epic tale told across multiple characters and continents, featuring the conclusion of some nearly 20-year-old plot threads that leave at least one character, quite literally and relatably, asleep in the streets. Some of this is the best work the developer has ever done, a new watermark for the series going forward. And some of it is some of the studio's worst. Like everything in Infinite Wealth, it's complicated.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infinite Wealth picks up a few years after the events of &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review-a-new-hero-takes-his-turn"&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/a&gt; and continues the story of dual-series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga, a former yakuza who's now taken up work trying to help rehabilitate other yakuza members back into society by finding them jobs. By the laws of narrative, this goes horribly wrong, and it's not long before Ichiban and friends, who now all find themselves out of work, are back in the folds of the criminal underworld. After the dissolution of the nation's two biggest families, the Tojo Clan and the Omi Alliance, in the previous game, the Seiryu Clan reigns supreme in Yokohama's Ijincho district. The group is not only working on its own dissolution program and trying to give former yakuza work, but it also has information on Ichiban's long-lost mother, Akane. He just needs to go to Hawaii to find her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once in Hawaii, Ichiban quickly runs into his counterpart and former star of the show Kiryu Kazuma. Kiryu plays a much larger role in this game than in Like a Dragon before it – mainly because he's also a playable character. Ichiban and Kiryu being playable in the same game represents a passing of the torch of sorts, and I truly love the time I got to spend with Kiryu. He's an old man now with cancer and a few months to live. He's coming to terms with his life, and Infinite Wealth goes a long way in softening and humanizing him. I always felt that letting Kiryu live after the events of Yakuza 6, where he faked his death, was the wrong call. This game reckons with that idea a lot, and even if I'm not totally sold on where it ends up, I like the road it takes to get there a lot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The dual protagonists also give the cast the chance to expand and breathe. At one point in the story, Kiryu and a small team of characters from the previous game return to Japan, leaving Ichiban with a cast of mostly new characters. The game jumps back and forth between the two, allowing tons of time to get to know everyone. I especially love newcomers Chitose and Tomizawa and never skipped a moment to learn more about the central cast. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving a bulk of the game's story to Hawaii allows RGG to open up its narrative potential. No longer confined to just Japan, the studio aims common issues facing America today – including further criticisms of the treatment of the unhoused and sex workers, something it examined in Japan in previous games. America's corrupt police state gets especially harsh criticism as we see how the police abuse its position to exploit common citizens and foreigners and ignore its roles within society. The Yakuza/Like a Dragon series has always been political, and RGG has always been very opinionated. While the studio &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/lost-judgment/lost-judgment-review-three-cheers-for-sweet-revenge"&gt;hasn't always stuck the landing&lt;/a&gt;, Infinite Wealth reinforces how the studio is insistent on tackling these concepts. Seeing a studio successfully approaching these issues with maturity is incredibly refreshing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's not to say this game isn't still about the yakuza. Infinite Wealth pulls from the real-world laws against former members of Japanese crime families. It examines whether or not they're actually useful means of rehabilitation while also looking at the ways these groups can be easily exploited by those in power. Kiryu, as a character, beautifully fits this narrative hook. He is a criminal, after all; for all the good he's done, his past is full of darkness. Ichiban, too. What does it mean to reintroduce criminals into society, rehabilitate them, allow them to be sorry, and offer them forgiveness? What does it mean to let these people live normal lives again, and will society ever actually allow that? The best moments of Infinite Wealth are when these questions are called into focus, and I was constantly surprised at the empathy and nuance RGG showed throughout the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it takes some pretty spectacular stumbles on the way to that greatness. Much of the Hawaii plotline revolves around the Palekana religious cult, which Akane is a member of, and its figurehead, Bryce Fairchild. For all the nuance and thought put into its real-world topics, the game's portrayal of cults and religious fanaticism is laughable at best and completely superfluous at worst. Bryce is certainly evil; it's just that he's evil in a way with no depth. RGG has gone to great lengths to humanize its villains and give meanings to their actions – and the other antagonists of Infinite Wealth have loads of interesting motives. But not Bryce. He's just a bad guy. And a boring one at that. The game is all too quick to shove the Palekana story aside, including characters it spent dozens of hours building up to focus on other topics. Almost like the game itself knows it isn't very good. It's unfortunate because this plotline is stacked against some of the best moments in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunate, too, is how that story is delivered. As usual, Infinite Wealth features some of the best acting in the entire game industry – most of the time. A lot of the Japanese talent behind the main cast is incredible, especially newcomers such as Satoru Iguchi, of King Gnu fame, who plays Tomizawa. His entire arc is wonderfully realized, moving, and funny. On the other hand, other characters fall entirely flat. For example, Bryce is written to be fluent in both Japanese and English. His Japanese is great. His English sounds like someone reading the words out phonetically in a different language. In fact, many of the American characters are clearly voiced by actors struggling to deliver their English lines. Switching to the English VO doesn't help much either, as the main cast feels awful when contrasted against who they are as people – with the exception of maybe Danny Trejo's character. The voice acting is full of odd choices such as this that, depending on the character, can really pull you out of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Infinite Wealth’s gameplay is often stellar across the board. As always, it's a joy to explore RGG's open worlds, and the three here – Kamurocho, Ijincho, and Honolulu – are all fantastic. Honolulu, especially, has a completely different vibe than other RGG worlds, and I loved exploring its bright beaches, seedy back streets, and luxurious hotel districts. Taking Kiryu back to the streets of Kamurocho is wonderfully nostalgic, too, and Infinite Wealth wastes no time letting him reminisce and enjoy his old haunts. I spent so much time taking Kiryu to places from the old games, loving how much thought went into how we would react.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You spend the vast majority of your time as you do in any other RGG game: beating the holy hell out of dudes in the street. Infinite Wealth continues Like a Dragon's change to turn-based combat, and the updates here make for a surprisingly deep and engaging system. Including directional and combo attacks adds interesting layers to how you approach an enemy. Exploiting an enemy's weakness and, in turn, having multiple members of your party dynamically attack the same foe in one turn consistently feels great. And I was always excited to see what new whacky animations I'd see when getting new magic attacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Is infinite wealth a good starting point for the series?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Probably not. I'd wager you'd need to play at least Yakuza 6: The Song of Life, Yakuza: Like a Dragon, Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name, and have some awareness of the rest of the mainline series to fully understand what's going on in Infinite Wealth. There are even passing mentions of the Judgment series, the zombie spin-off Yakuza: Dead Souls, Like a Dragon: Ishin!, and a game that never came to America. If you haven't done your homework, best of luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infinite Wealth's job system – effectively how you change character classes and a returning mechanic from the previous game – creates a ton of interesting team line-ups, and I really enjoyed experimenting and building out as well-rounded a party as I could. Upgrading your job level also allows you to import skills from other jobs, leading to some truly dynamic characters with various elemental attacks. That said, while I do love combat, grinding out levels in the game's dungeon was a real chore at times – boring, monotonous, and took way too long for its own good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your mileage will vary with the game's unbelievable amount of side content. Infinite Wealth surprised me with its substories, which I've historically never really enjoyed in other games. Here, I found some of them deeply funny (there's one about a dating app that's great) and well-thought-out. I also enjoyed a lot of the mini-games, such as the Crazy Taxi-inspired food delivery game and finding all the optional conversations and character links. However, I did not enjoy the Animal Crossing-inspired Dondoko Island or the Pokémon-like collecting and fighting games, which I found incredibly dull and convoluted. Luckily, they are optional after their introduction, but that intro grinds the game to a halt so it can slowly explain all the various rules and mechanics. There are plenty of other side activities I didn't have time to even touch, and I imagine there are easily 100-plus hours of the game for the most dedicated. Some of it's pretty dang good. I just hope I never have to go back to Dondoko Island ever again.&lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/06/11/0fb3e583/likeadragon02.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p&gt;Infinite Wealth is a swing for the fences for RGG. At one point, the Yakuza series was a cult classic relegated to small fanbases outside of Japan. That changed in 2017 when Yakuza 0 finally hit it big. By the time Yakuza: Like a Dragon came out in 2020, it was clear RGG had a phenomenon on its hands. The result of that success is a massive game brimming with things to do and say. Sometimes, it's too much. There's a version of Infinite Wealth that leaves a lot on the cutting room floor and saves itself loads of tedium. There were so many hours that I wished that was the game I was playing instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yet, I can't help but be amazed by what it does pull off over its impressively long run-time. It's rare to see a triple-A video game have anything worthwhile to say about the need for criminal rehabilitation, the police state, and even nuclear disposal. Somehow, this game has all those topics and smart (albeit somewhat surface-level) things to say about them. I'm shocked that its combat system consistently felt new and fresh after 60 hours and that I was finding new ways to use it. That it gave me so much time with some of my favorite characters in video games, allowing me to know them so much deeper than I ever knew before, was just the cherry on top.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of the final moments of Infinite Wealth, one of the characters falls exhausted into the street, beaten down by everything that just came before. As he does so, he looks satisfied and happy, even though arguably nothing is going right for him at that moment. In a lot of ways, I felt the exact same by the end of the game. I was tired. And yet, I was also ready to see what this crew would get up to next. &lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Tekken 8 Review – Aggressively Absurd

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The bar for the fighting game genre has been uppercut to astronomical heights in recent years. Exceptional one-on-one combat remains the primary bullet point, but other series have complimented their packages with robust suites of destinations, from cinematic story campaigns to comprehensive training dojos. Although Tekken 8’s fighting remains a treat thanks to some neat tweaks to its strong formula, the rest of the package, while respectable, falls short of some of its contemporaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch Our Tekken 8 Review:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U0iCQ-vCJww" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Heat system is the big new addition, adding a new gauge that, when activated, adds chip damage to attacks, buffs your blocks, and even adds follow-up moves to extend certain combos. My favorite use is spending the full meter to unleash a unique and powerful combo attack, and weaving this into an assault can be devastating. Heat offers a fun and effective new trick that rewards aggression while also providing a solid counter to an opponent’s relentless assault. Combined with the returning Rage system, it’s another way to help turn the tide of a one-sided battle without feeling like a protective crutch – pure skill still wins the day.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rage Arts have been smartly simplified to a universal button for easier execution and more spectacular finishes. Another good tweak is that health bars are divided into sections displaying recoverable and non-recoverable HP, the former of which is replenished by attacking (even if blocked). I like seeing when I should turn up the heat to regain a few hit points. I also like being encouraged to end an opponent before they can heal themselves, once again promoting aggression in a way that speaks to my playstyle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_MM4clV2qjE" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tweaks aside, as far as the basic meat and potatoes go, if you want some good old-fashioned Tekken, this eighth entry delivers. The 32-character roster feels as great as it ever has, and new faces, such as the enigmatic Reina or the coffee-obsessed Azucena, are fun additions I’m enjoying mastering. Tekken 8 also scores a win in the looker category. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, our favorite combatants have never looked or been animated better. Stages pop and are packed with details, whether you’re battling under the neon lights of an urban city square or amid Peruvian ruins with roaming alpacas. As nice as they appear, they fall apart even better when you’re knocking opponents through walls or slamming them through the floor.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tekken 8’s cinematic story mode, which centers on the ultimate clash between Jin and Kazuya, is a step above Tekken 7’s. Admittedly, that’s a low bar to cross; not having a monotone journalist narrate the tale already raises it several notches. Absurdity is the name of the game, thanks to the narrative’s onslaught of laugh-worthy action scenes, culminating in a final bout that takes the series as high as it’s ever been on the “outrageous” meter. While more fun than Tekken 7’s story, Tekken 8’s tale is still an uneven experience. A choose-your-fighter tournament arc in the middle is a cool idea, but your selection is meaningless. A gigantic battle reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War&lt;/em&gt; unfolds as a generic, ill-designed brawler where players pummel waves of foes in a manner reminiscent of Tekken 3’s Tekken Force mode, and feels just as dated. The final confrontation, while epic, drags on for so many rounds that it becomes a slog. It almost feels like a parody of climactic boss fights while playing it totally straight.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the main story mode is a solid starting point for Tekken 8, Arcade Quest offers another narrative-driven quest better suited for teaching players the ropes. As a customizable Xbox 360-esque avatar, you and your Tekken-obsessed friends travel to various arcades to climb the ranks of the competitive scene while learning the power of friendship and having fun. It does a decent job of providing thorough tutorials on new mechanics like the Heat system and teaching helpful combos and general fight psychology, making it ideal for both newcomers and returning veterans. The downside is suffering through a supremely bland tale that feels more like a saccharine lesson in fighting game etiquette (i.e., let people play how they want and don’t be a jerk) for kids.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/22/497cbb67/tekken_8_lars.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/22/702ca1cb/tekken_8_devil_jin.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/22/15385443/tekken_8_azucena.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/11/fe9de059/ss_avatarcustomizationscreen_12.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/11/8addbe47/tk8_jin_battle_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/03/23/6765c2a6/3-2._heat_engager_-_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Offline offerings are otherwise underwhelming. Character Episodes remain succinct ladder climbs to watch Tekken’s trademark humorous fighter endings. Tekken Ball returns as a cute addition, but nothing worth revisiting after a round or two. I enjoyed testing myself in Super Ghost Battle, which pits you against a learning A.I. mirroring your behavior and tendencies. While the practice mode features robust breakdowns of stats such as frame data, a more guided experience would have been welcomed. You’re still largely left to wade through menus for desired lessons (which boil down to inputting commands without much context as to why it’s effective and when to use them) and sift through tons of combo lists. The Gallery is disappointingly slim compared to 7’s, leaving the bulk of fight money spent on unlocking new pieces for the popular character creator.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardcore players will likely spend their time trading blows in the largely smooth online mode. Bandai Namco has jazzed up online play with an explorable hub to show off your Arcade Quest avatar while challenging players to bouts. This presentation is mostly for show; you still access the same menu options available elsewhere. But it adds a little flair to the tried-and-true fun of gaining ranks and spectating fights.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a complete package, Tekken 8 doesn’t reach the heights of recent rivals like Street Fighter 6 and Mortal Kombat 1. But when the match begins, and you’re exploiting openings to unleash flashy combo strings and air juggles, it remains a thrilling, if very familiar, one-on-one experience. The latest King of Iron Fist tournament still has work to do to feel wholly satisfying or ground-breaking, but it remains a fun arena to test your mettle against friends and rivals.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Outsiders of the Ace Attorney series might not be familiar with the name Apollo Justice, but fans know the character is a big deal. He's second only to Phoenix Wright in terms of playable appearances, and his new collection, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, gathers all of those outings in one convenient package. While there's not much new content, quality-of-life improvements and a visual overhaul do a lot to modernize Apollo's courtroom saga, making it a worthwhile journey for fans new and old.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collection includes three games: Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney, Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies, and Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice. While Apollo's name is only in one of these three titles, he's a crucial character in all three games, so the name is a fitting one. The package also includes DLC trials and outfits from the 3DS games, so if you want to rock Phoenix's classic suit in Dual Destinies or dress Athena as a maid in Spirit of Justice, you're free to do so. The DLC trials vary in quality (the second is great, the first is not), but they're meaty pieces of content that I'm glad made it into the final collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;





Apollo Justice prepares for his first trial in Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney

&lt;p&gt;Besides the obvious convenience of being available on modern platforms, there are two main reasons to play the Apollo Justice Ace Attorney Trilogy instead of the original games. The first is the improved graphics; the Trilogy looks excellent. I'll miss the pixel art of the DS days, but I quickly got used to the updated art style in Apollo Justice's first outing. The animations translate exceptionally well – the series hasn't lost an ounce of charm. The real improvement, however, comes in the latter two games in the Trilogy, which were originally released on the 3DS. While the first game is a good translation of the old art style into a new form, the 3D games look much better, and I often had to remind myself they weren't released on the Switch from the get-go. It's also great to view their anime cutscenes on a full-sized TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other reason to play the Trilogy over old versions is its wonderful suite of quality-of-life improvements. I especially love Auto Advance, which moves the dialogue forward without forcing me to mash buttons, and the History button, which allows you to scroll back through dialogue you might've accidentally skipped. This game also includes a story setting, which automatically advances the game through trials and investigations if you don't feel like solving any puzzles. While they're mostly returning features from other modern Ace Attorney collections, the quality of life improvements return for a reason – they make these games significantly smoother to play, and I am extremely grateful to have them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;





Athena Cykes in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Dual Destinies

&lt;p&gt;Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy also includes a Museum section that allows players to look at concept art, listen to music, rewatch cutscenes, and look at character animations from each game in the Trilogy. It's a nice touch, and I had some fun glancing at some of the art and animations, but it's more of a novelty than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outside of quality-of-life improvements, the games are unchanged and still worth your time. Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney is a relatively faithful continuation of the original Trilogy that stars Apollo Justice, a plucky new protagonist. With 2D art and game direction by series creator Shu Takumi, it's essentially an epilogue to the original Phoenix Wright games, giving players a glimpse into its world seven years after Ace Attorney 3. Today, its trials hold up as an exciting exploration of the failings of the court system and why it's important to let a new generation take the reins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney honors the older games, Dual Destinies seeks to forge a separate path with a new game director, three protagonists, and a new 3D art style. It's the weakest game of the series, especially at the start, but the last few trials tie everything together with a genuinely satisfying conclusion. Its ambitions don't always pay off, but now that a decade has passed, I can appreciate those ambitions more, especially how they paved the road for the next game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;





Phoenix Wright in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice

&lt;p&gt;Spirit of Justice is the final game in the Trilogy and my favorite. It primarily occurs in the fictional country of Kura'in, where defense attorneys are sentenced to the same fates as those they defend. To complicate things even further, the royal family can conduct séances to play back the memories of the dead as evidence. The new location and heightened stakes do a lot to make this entry feel distinct from the others. In fact, Spirit of Justice is the first game in the Trilogy that doesn't feel like it's struggling to match the tone of the older games, fully setting itself apart by putting its trials in a new context. It's not just the best in this collection; it's one of my favorites in the entire series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy succeeds with everything it sets out to do, bringing three great games to modern consoles in their most approachable forms to date. I was fully immersed in its classic courtroom battles in the 80 or so hours it took me to get through all three titles. Even though not every trial is a winner, the majority are, and with a new suite of quality-of-life improvements, it's never been easier or more enjoyable to experience Apollo Justice's journey.&lt;/p&gt;

      Mature
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Asgard’s Wrath 2 stands out in a sea of virtual reality titles available on the market today. As the showcase piece for the Meta Quest 3, this sequel offers an experience rarely seen in the category, weaving together an exciting blend of action, intricate puzzle design, and semi-open-world environments. With the clever use of VR mechanics, you discover new surprises even after playing for dozens of hours. Asgard’s Wrath 2 is a VR game that’s difficult to put down, even as the Quest 3’s battery life often requires you to. However, while it does start out strong, it hits a few stumbling blocks along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asgard’s Wrath 2 immediately follows the events of the first game. The god of mischief, Loki, has managed to escape, and it's up to you to track him down. The big difference now is that your journey takes you to the vast sand seas of Egypt, where you meet other deities willing to help you in your search.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s an immense world just waiting to be explored, which gave me a sense of awe as I looked at my surroundings and the sheer scope of what Sanzaru Games crafted. Moreover, the game’s visual flair, powered solely by a standalone headset like the Quest 3, remained impressive from a technical standpoint as I ventured through the picturesque landscape in this lengthy action RPG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3SYJeM_LaZ0" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you play through Asgard’s Wrath 2, you control distinct heroes with their respective narrative arcs. For example, you encounter the warrior Abraxas as he’s robbing a tomb. Later on, you control the river nymph Cyrene in her own chapter. You also meet various animal companions, such as a boar that can wade through lava and a panther that can cause illusory blocks to solidify. These concepts, in terms of traversal and puzzle-solving, make each companion’s functions quite unique, though the A.I. noticeably fumbles during battles. In some cases, they won’t even attack an enemy right next to them until you manually target that foe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combat mechanics push the boundaries of what VR gameplay can be, thanks to each hero’s assortment of weapons. This arsenal creates genuinely unique and refreshing playstyles. For instance, I’d get into the thick of the fray as Abraxas, slashing with a whip-sword in my right hand while tossing axes with my left. Meanwhile, the ranger Alvilda required me to perform rapid flicking motions to shoot different magic arrows. Surprisingly enough, the most mechanically complex character was an undead scribe named Djehuty; I had to place both hands in front of my headset and make a pulling motion to decapitate the character; then, I could use the head to possess foes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regrettably, I had a few issues with the controls, especially when grabbing weapons, since the controller has difficulty detecting the action unless I sit upright. Likewise, throwing weapons or firing projectiles, even with aim assist options enabled, became frustrating and tiring.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/15/4856763e/aw2_screenshot_subiraride_eng_announce_16x9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/15/1b36dd88/aw2_screenshot_scorpionwhip_eng_announce_16x9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/15/911b8789/aw2_screenshot_templeatumpuzzle_eng_announce_16x9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/15/38184699/aw2_screenshot_weavers_eng_announce_16x9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/15/dedb55a3/aw2_screenshot_cyrenecombat_eng_announce_16x9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/15/f5f16d87/aw2_screenshot_paahketabrax_eng_announce_16x9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the most fascinating feature of Asgard’s Wrath 2 is its puzzles, which show what can truly be achieved by VR games in terms of immersion, creativity, and engagement. Since you’re playing as a god, you can use your divine form to take control of larger structures, often switching to your hero character, who then traverses the area with the help of animal companions. The highest praise I can give Asgard’s Wrath 2 is that, at times, it feels like the Zelda VR game enthusiasts have been waiting for. Major puzzles are presented as grand set pieces – moments that filled me with wonder upon reaching these sections and a sense of satisfaction upon coming up with a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the sheer abundance of puzzles leads to poor pacing during specific segments, such as escaping a dungeon’s traps, only to realize that another brain teaser awaited instead of a climactic boss battle. The game’s last few chapters also feel rushed compared to the arcs of the first two heroes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Asgard’s Wrath 2 still boasts an epic campaign that can take upwards of 70 hours to complete, chockful of numerous locales, lairs, and secrets to discover. Likewise, an infinitely replayable roguelike mode is waiting for you well after you're done with the campaign and the overworld areas. In spite of a few qualms, Asgard’s Wrath 2 remains an offering worthy of the gods.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Prince of Persia series has a long and storied history going back decades, and I know none of it. The latest, Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, from developer Ubisoft Montpellier, has me regretting that because if this game indicates what else awaits me in the franchise, I’ve clearly been missing out. The Lost Crown uses exhilarating platforming, a deep combat loop, and more to create a new Metroidvania classic. While I would like a more compelling story and a few tweaks to its systems, I struggled to put The Lost Crown down, taking my gameplay sessions into the late hours of the night. The Lost Crown is a fascinating and highly successful reemergence for the beloved series. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown Video Review&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZlgUVypJCrc" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notably, you do not play as the Prince of Persia in The Lost Crown; instead, you control Sargon, one of the seven Immortals, elite warriors who protect Persia, its Queen Thomyris, and the titular Prince Ghassan. However, Ghassan is kidnapped, sending the Immortals to Mount Qaf, where a labyrinthian adventure awaits Sargon and friends. The entire game takes place here, and by the end of my 21-hour adventure, I intimately knew its various biomes, secrets, shortcuts, and safe havens. One of my favorite parts of The Lost Crown was watching the foggy map of Mount Qaf reveal itself as a series of connected hallways, hidden chambers, and platforming puzzle playgrounds, in part because exploring all of it was an absolute treat. However, I would have liked a better fast-travel system, and sometimes there’s too much backtracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On current-gen consoles, The Lost Crown runs at a smooth-as-butter 120 frames per second, with a 4K resolution to boot. I’m not the biggest fan of its art style, which features gorgeous backdrops and painterly environments but playdough-esque characters, but it’s hard to deny how good it all looks in motion. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/09/4af2df1c/pop_7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/09/4c154706/pop_8.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/09/0521fd3d/pop_10.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;The Lost Crown stands tall, if not above in most instances, to some of the genre’s best. Combat starts simple, with a heavy emphasis on parrying, but grows into a deep system of extended ground attacks, air combos, projectile combo extenders, fast dash-kicks, and more. Amulets with special properties, like increased melee damage or frost resistance, for example, are hidden throughout, further adding to the customization of your Sargon. Athra Surges use special energy built up through combat and they can shift the weight of an encounter in an instant. And to round out the toolkit, Sargon collects time powers throughout the journey, which grant him powerful abilities for use in combat and exploration. &lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/09/911beb17/pop_4_0.jpg" alt="Prince of Persia The Lost Crown Game Informer Review Metroidvania Ubisoft" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p&gt;Like the various puzzles of Mount Qaf, every encounter presents its own predicament; I had to think fast and attack faster to take down new enemies with moves I hadn’t seen. And bosses are the combat’s crème de la crème. Each boss capped off the learning experience The Lost Crown put me through in the preceding hours, requiring the use of every tool in my arsenal (and every healing flask, too). I welcomed new boss fights, even after the fifth attempt on some of its most challenging. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/09/1de38f5c/pop_9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2024/01/09/6bcfff66/pop_2_0.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;The same can be said for its platforming. Quick respawning and instant resets carve out the worst parts of platformers, leaving a trial-and-error experience that remains highly rewarding throughout the game. A tough-as-nails platforming section that requires perfect precision might lead you to a rare currency that helps you strengthen Sargon’s swords, a special petal that increases his total health, or even a miniboss; I was never disappointed with what awaited me, a critical component to an enriching Metroidvania experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a robust suite of accessibility options, like the ability to adjust the parry window timing, increase or decrease how much health you take on hits (and how much enemies take from yours, too), and portals that let you skip platforming sections, you can fine-tune The Lost Crown to be the experience you want. It’s a commendable effort and speaks to Ubisoft’s Montpellier’s innovation in this ever-growing genre. Being able to quickly attach a Memory Shard, which acts like an in-universe screenshot, to the massive map makes keeping track of what you can and can’t do at any moment a breeze. Coupled with various pins you can attach to the map, it’s a feature set I want in every game like this moving forward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story, despite some twists and turns that genuinely surprised me, fell into the background too often, and I struggled to understand why I was going &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;there&lt;/em&gt; beyond the objective marker on my screen. But this and its few other issues did little to hamper my enjoyment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lost Crown makes it hard to put the controller down, constantly urging players to follow its paths just a little further. Following its persistent pull to explore more of Mount Qaf is easy, though, thanks to how good it feels to do so. Between its first-rate platforming and engaging combat and progression, The Lost Crown’s various parts coalesce into a sublime loop. Gameplay is king, and this Prince of Persia understands that. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Finals offers rare novelty in the competitive multiplayer genre, encouraging creative strategies impossible in other titles because of its immense environmental destruction, physics-based hazards, and armory of whimsical gadgets. This first-person shooter occurs amid a digital game show where varying counts of three-person teams fight over money caches in an objective-focused format. The Finals is unpredictable in the best way: gameshow events like meteor showers or orbital lasers remap previously memorized paths, map variants like moving platforms or suspended structures can obfuscate objectives, and your team’s best-laid defensive plans are often interrupted as explosives obliterate the buildings around you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;Developer Embark Studios showcases its mastery of Unreal Engine with gorgeously lit, fully destructible level designs that are incredibly fun to maneuver. Monaco, Las Vegas, Seoul, and Skyway Stadium – the four maps present at release – require distinct strategies and feature randomized elements that make every match impressively dynamic. You might load a map and find it under construction or unrecognizable, such as when sandstorms cover Vegas with enormous dunes.&lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/22/e9717d62/2023-12-16_14-55-39.mp4_.00_23_25_26.still001.png" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;The game features three unique classes: Heavy, Medium, and Light. Heavies can equip a rocket-propelled grenade, flamethrower, energy shield, a massive sledgehammer, or a glue gun that allows the user to create makeshift walls and cover. Mediums most closely resemble a support role, featuring the option to equip a healing beam, automated turret, zipline systems, jump pads, and defibrillators for quick revives. Lastly, the Light class specializes in grappling hook traversal and multiple invisibility gadgets. Each role is satisfying to explore, offering numerous possibilities for emergent play. Witnessing brilliant synergies like propelling the Cashout – an ATM-like objective – toward the opposite side of the arena by using the Heavy’s rocket to bounce the object atop a Medium’s well-placed jump pad leaves me energized and curious. Ultimately, team collaboration is crucial in finding success in The Finals since the skill ceiling becomes much higher with these potent equipment combinations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;It’s incredibly satisfying to interrupt an enemy team’s attempt at stealing the objective (an ATM-like device) by blowing the floor from beneath them with an RPG or C4 pack and ambushing them as they unexpectedly fall to a lower level. On the flip side, you can avoid a perilous fall with a well-timed goo grenade, creating a makeshift floor or bridge where one didn’t exist before. The reactive, high-stakes strategies the physics system facilitates remind me of the breakneck decisions that define the best fighting games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;Ignoring current multiplayer trends, The Finals features sturdy health bars, long respawn times, the exclusion of multiple weapon slots, and a lack of scopes on most guns. While using the iron sights on larger weapons like the M60 light machine gun is sometimes tricky because the optic’s alignment markers obscure my view, I admire Embark’s commitment to novelty through these choices, as they reinforce a focus on gadgets, environmental destruction, and the creative strategies that emerge from the intersection of those features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;However, in a game with many well-designed characteristics, Embark’s use of generative A.I. text-to-speech voicework is unappealing. The gameshow’s characters sound believable at best but broadly fall flat due to one-note performances and mediocre writing. Additionally, I’ve heard duplicate voice lines multiple times, making the developer’s use of generative art largely pointless.&lt;/p&gt;

 

&lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;Notably, the cosmetic microtransactions are fairly priced and offer robust character customization. Whether earning a new skin via the battle pass or purchasing it from the in-game shop, you can equip various parts of the outfit and pair them with others. Despite the slow progression of the battle pass, which I hope is adjusted in the future, the mix-and-match nature of its rewards makes them exciting to unlock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;The Finals has given me some of my favorite multiplayer moments in 2023. Whether actively engaging in vertical combat or excitedly scaling rooftops on the way to the next objective, navigating the environments feels incredible, and the thrill of watching the ground disappear from below my feet never gets old. In a year of groundbreaking video game releases, The Finals is yet another highlight.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Dragon Quest possesses so much history that any new game carries a degree of raised expectation. Dragon Quest Monsters: The Dark Prince delivers many of the conventions I’ve come to expect from the series: the vibrant opening song, the charismatic Slime, and the emotional storytelling I already associate with the franchise. But this game goes beyond those well-treaded territories, offering an intelligent and elegant yet simple approach to combat and dungeon design that makes it a solid spin-off experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In The Dark Prince, you play as Psaro, a half-human, half-monster boy who becomes a powerful monster wrangler because of a curse that makes fighting them with his own hands impossible. Wrangling is all about capturing monsters and controlling them during turn-based battles. As I progressed throughout the boy’s journey, I found stronger creatures to add to my roster. The game also has an online mode that lets you fight other players, which is a good way to test different group compositions. In my case, it took so long to find a match that my time was better spent adventuring solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Synthesizing new monsters by fusing two parent creatures is the best method to obtain a better team, and this system makes all your effort in previously maximizing weaker monsters worth it. Whenever you create a new monster, it’s possible to keep some of the skill points spent in the creatures you’re fusing. Through this system, I crafted some extremely powerful monsters, surpassing their regular versions found in the wild. This system pushes you towards excessive grinding, though. Whenever you fuse a new creature, it comes at level 1, regardless of its parents' levels. In the final sections of the game, fusing a new monster at the wrong moment means spending a lot of time leveling up before getting back on track and trying to defeat a boss.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/15/9236ead8/dqm_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/15/0549b3bd/dqm_6_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/15/9357553c/dqm_6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/15/80a90e6d/dqm_july10_16.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/15/01158c5e/screenshot_7_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/15/6e168a01/screenshot_9_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/12/15/1a0df227/dqm_04.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;With the vast number of possible monster combinations you can create in The Dark Prince, I was surprised by how streamlined combat is. The game allows you to set up tactics that define whether a party member will focus on attacking enemies or healing other party members, for example. At the same time, it’s possible to order specific actions for each monster. However, outside of boss fights, engaging more strategically in battles rarely felt necessary. The system waters down so much of each encounter that I usually entered automatic mode and let the A.I. do the thinking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the boy works on his craft, we learn about Psaro’s past and his journey alongside his friends, Rose and Toilen, to become strong enough to challenge his father. This is a classic, almost too familiar, premise, but even with the absence of heavily foreshadowed surprises or plot twists, The Dark Prince captivated me, making for a cozy adventure with the charm of an old-fashioned fairy tale.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game presents the same slow-paced introduction other Dragon Quest games have, making the first few hours a slog. However, I became slowly entangled in the story. Initially, I was progressing only to unlock new monsters, but I realized I was as excited about learning more about Psaro’s tale as I was about finding new creatures. Unfortunately, very few situations offer even a glimpse of what he’s thinking, and it never gave me a chance to understand the reasoning behind his acts better. In this aspect, the game’s respect for its roots hinders its capacity to develop an intriguing character with no option besides nodding or saying yes or no.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While perfectly capable as a standalone title, The Dark Prince is directly connected to Dragon Quest IV. It gives us a chance to learn more about Psaro, a crucial figure in the older title, and also to look over some events related to the previous game from a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OmM25YS8Wo0" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Psaro’s journey takes us through areas in Nadiria, a magical dimension with different regions called circles. Each circle splits into three tiers, with one final dungeon. Sadly, this structure makes for a repetitive and predictable pattern; after completing the first four circles, I knew exactly what to expect from every new region. These areas are made worse by noticeable dips in performance, as the framerate suffers considerably. While I could easily ignore these minor performance issues, the circles’ recursive design became more tiresome whenever I went for long gameplay sessions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the dungeons are the most surprising element of each circle. They all share a similar structure: many floors, a traversal gimmick, and a teleport before the boss room. While they might feel as repetitive as the circles, the puzzles inside each dungeon make them fun and varied. The developers found a solid balance between difficulty and enjoyment when designing them. The Dark Prince veers more toward traditional dungeon design, with treadmills you need to activate to advance or ladders and holes in the ground to get to the top of the building. Though most dungeons are forgettable, they offer a refreshing intellectual experience even without leaning on any design extravaganza.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By rigidly following Dragon Quest traditions, we end up with flat, cartoonish characters who inhabit a repetitive, cyclical world. But The Dark Prince plays to its strengths to deliver a solid RPG experience with a cozy narrative seasoned by a long list of charismatic creatures and entertaining dungeons.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p style="margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px"&gt;The Avatar films are great fun but have never blown me away with original storytelling. Instead, the translation of familiar formulas into a vibrant and visually arresting alien world elevates the films. Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora follows that same tack, featuring first-person exploration and combat that borrows liberally from franchises like Far Cry. But here, an enormous and detailed fantasy world breathes life into the experience, making it both more engaging and sometimes needlessly obtuse – but always with a flair for the source material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While concurrent with the movies, Frontiers of Pandora tells a separate standalone story about a small group of young Na’vi raised by the villainous and ecologically reckless RDA, and one individual Na’vi’s gradual rediscovery of their heritage and connection to nature. The overt environmental themes of the franchise are accentuated by a pointed indictment of child separation and forced re-education among indigenous populations. Developer Massive Entertainment has done a phenomenal job capturing the unique fictional nuances of the Na’vi, adding several fresh wrinkles in the form of new clans and individuals. It’s a genuine treat for franchise fans that adds substantially to the lore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sIYHK0Q2Jkc" width="640"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gameplay is all about running and leaping through dense jungles, plains, and caves, while simultaneously learning the many secrets of Pandora’s flora and fauna. The richness of the ecosystems is unmatched in any game I’ve encountered. I had fun learning the properties and potential of the many strange living things along my path. As I did, new skills and gear enhanced my Na’vi’s potential, and I steadily climbed to mastery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The visual presentation is gorgeous and does justice to the many colors and majestic natural backdrops from the films. Surprisingly, the lush and detailed world was both a joy and hindrance. Sometimes, the onscreen visuals are so overgrown and hard to parse that the game becomes visually confusing. I frequently became lost in the overwhelming stimuli, often missing key objects or clues amid the clutter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving through these richly presented landscapes is great fun, thanks to a generous traversal system of climbing, jumping, sliding, and environmental objects (like plants that bounce you high into the air) that combine to memorable effect and lead to smooth and parkour-like navigation. Enhancing exploration is your dragon-like Ikran mount, allowing you to fly across the vast map easily and quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, combat using bows and assault rifles adds punch to the action, often accompanied by the chance to take an alternate stealthy route instead. I found both experiences good but not great. Too few tools and abilities allow for stealth approaches, so taking my chances with a fast and direct approach was usually more expeditious. The battles themselves are intense and lethal but rarely elevated above an attempt to peek from behind cover points for pot shots at bad guys. Active close-range melees align more with the expectations established by the movies, but that approach is usually not viable.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Hunting, gathering, crafting, and cooking are central features. There’s a lot to experiment with, and creating that great new chest piece or fish dish can sometimes be thrilling. But I eventually found the breadth of options overwhelming. Dozens of different tree barks, mosses, animal hides, and pine cones – many of which can only be optimally gathered at certain times of day or weather conditions – eventually began to swim together in my mind. The game virtually demands that you engage with these mechanics to make meaningful progress, and I frequently found it got in the way of narrative pacing, or it became too frustrating to track down the things I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between the action and exploration, Frontiers of Pandora puts a wealth of more minor mechanics and systems in your way. Again, these often hamper the fun as frequently as adding to it. Hacking constant power systems and doors, tedious investigations for forensic clues in a scene, tracking multiple currencies and favor with the clans – there’s so much here that it sometimes distracts from what’s genuinely fun: the action and discovery of a breathtaking alien landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even so, I found a lot to love in Frontiers of Pandora, including the welcome addition of two-player online cooperative play, which lets players enjoy the game with a friend. With time, the many interlocking features started to make sense, and I pushed past any frustrations to find a remarkably large and rewarding game. Enter Pandora’s vast wilderness with patience and a willingness for a measured march to understanding, and I suspect you’ll uncover what I did – a flawed but still praiseworthy addition to this growing science fiction universe.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The most endearing aspect of the SteamWorld series is how each of its games relates to one another despite their disparate genres. From tower defense to turn-based RPG, each title offers a unique spin on a specific gameplay experience while adhering to a shared mythos, resulting in a fun collection of games that coalesce thematically. SteamWorld Build, Thunderful's city-builder/RTS hybrid, serves as the latest iteration of this formula. Sporting streamlined genre mechanics, intuitive controls, and charming visuals, many essential parts are in place. Unfortunately, despite a solid foundation, SteamWorld Build struggles to maintain an engaging experience throughout its campaign.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most of the SteamWorld series, Build doesn't directly connect to any of the previous games. Instead, it tries to provide a unique perspective on critical events that feed into the series' overarching narrative. This familiar setup works in parts. The plight of a group of travelers settling near an abandoned mine at the behest of a mysterious robot companion is initially attractive. Fans will especially enjoy the nods to past happenings and some extra lore surrounding an established planetary threat. That said, it won't take long for players to realize that SteamWorld Build's campaign is paper thin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the SteamWorld series isn't known for its character-driven stories, each new release offers more meaningful reasons to dive into its steampunk universe. SteamWorld Build's nearly nonexistent story is a step backward in this regard. There aren't any notable characters, worthwhile encounters, or imaginative events to speak of. Essentially, the why of it all doesn't matter, as the campaign's few cutscenes offer just enough exposition for it to be considered a means to an end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Story woes aside, SteamWorld Build is entertaining. This is partially due to the streamlined approach to city-building and solid tutorial prompts. There are some genre staples, especially when it comes to building placement. You'll be told, for instance, to place Foresters (a giant tree-chopping machine) and lumber mills next to wooded areas to acquire logs. But most of the finer details involving the inner workings of a town/city – tax rates, zoning, population density in relation to the neighboring structures – are either handled automatically or simplified to a large degree.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/228c5654/3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/d0840c30/4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/10edf0d1/5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/9f460a0d/6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/896b78bd/7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/70438bf2/1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/875373e9/2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;There's no urban decay or adverse environmental issues to worry about. As long as your buildings are connected to their corresponding facilities and the central train station by road, they'll function as expected. And since the game's intuitive controls (whether using a gamepad or keyboard and mouse) do most of the heavy lifting, nearly every action can be carried out with just a few button presses. SteamWorld Build is more arcade than sim, offering a welcoming experience for newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its simplified mechanics, SteamWorld Build appeals to genre vets thanks to its puzzling play. Instead of fixating on every minor detail linked to actual urban planning, the game emphasizes keeping your steambots happy by placing key structures. Your workers, who start economically at the bottom of the totem pole, are usually satiated by a general store and service shop. They don't need much to stay productive. Once you hit certain milestones, usually tied to the town's number of employable steambots, you can upgrade them into engineers. This next tier of citizens requires more service buildings and attractions to stay in good spirits. They also pay more in taxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your main goal is to develop your town to the point where its citizens can mine specific relics (namely rocket parts) needed to escape a seemingly dying planet. This makes the continual growth of your town important as each tier of citizen is responsible for specific branches of productivity. This process can prove tricky as the requirements needed to satisfy them all are weighed against your town's overall needs. Creating too many workers means spending less money on new construction projects. Too few, and you won't have enough steambots to gather the basic materials (wood, coal, etc.) needed to keep the town functioning. The same goes for higher-tiered citizens; their larger financial contributions are offset by the cost of keeping them content.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Learning to juggle these different factors is vital when playing SteamWorld Build early on. Some of it comes down to properly positioning certain services and attractions. Plopping a general store at the corner of an intersection makes it accessible to more workers. You can also use stat-boosting items, tradable resources, improved roads, and more. Your management duties double once you gain access to the mines. These underground areas feature RTS mechanics requiring a more hands-on approach. Instead of buildings, you place miner, prospector, mechanic, and guard quarters needed to spawn the corresponding steambots around the map. Aside from the guards and mechanics – who are there to protect and heal bots/build machines, respectively – these bots aren't autonomous. They must be assigned jobs like mining gold deposits, knocking down walls, placing turrets to repel pests, and building machines to harvest important materials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of my time playing SteamWorld Build was spent hopping between my town's surface and subterranean areas. Watching the tiny steambots carry out their tasks as I slowly upgraded my residential areas was fun. I also enjoyed overseeing the developments underground; micromanaging these steambots offered a nice contrast to the above-ground activities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of that changed during the game's last few hours due to a combination of competing systems. To collect the final component needed to leave the planet, I had to turn a few of my bots into scientists and make sure they were content for a set duration of time. The problem is that this directive has no wiggle room. When the other steambots weren't at 100 percent, and their collective numbers started to dwindle, the few that remained still pitched in. That wasn't the case here, as it was an all-or-nothing situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gz0V9Z9SPgk" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other issue was that the scientist was the highest citizen level, meaning it takes a lot to keep them happy. Since my town had grown, it was easy for a given resource – water, food, etc. – to occasionally dip below a certain threshold. During those moments, my scientists became unhappy. I tried to mitigate some of this by improving all my roads, trading for the needed items, relocating attractions, buffing facilities, and so on. Nothing worked. The only thing I could do was wait for my steambots to produce enough of whatever was missing to meet my scientists' needs briefly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many sim-based games have this point where the player has seemingly optimized themselves into a corner. Their final objective is within reach, but because its strict parameters don't allow for alternative completion options, they can only wait as the game plays. That's what happens with SteamWorld Build. It's a shame, considering how enjoyable the core gameplay loop initially is. Things fare a little better once you've finished the campaign, though. Since each of the five maps offers rewards like free roads or faster miners upon completion, starting a new campaign with these unlocked bonuses is possible. You can also sidestep the story and focus on building the best town you can, which might be the ideal scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SteamWorld Build is a unique hybrid that entertains for a time. Its early hours are fun, thanks to how well it uses simplified genre staples to create a more arcade-friendly gameplay loop, a sentiment bolstered by a solid tutorial and intuitive control scheme. Regrettably, SteamWorld Build's campaign overstays its welcome. The lackluster story and rigid final objectives turn what was initially an engaging experience into a tedious grind.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>The Talos Principle II Review – Profoundly Puzzling

      Teen
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The Talos Principle II often left me staring at my screen in awe. Sometimes, from sheer intimidation in the face of a seemingly formidable puzzle. Other times,&amp;nbsp; from my incredulous pride after unraveling said problem. But most of all, the experience regularly gave me pause as I pondered a philosophical idea or argument that challenged my viewpoints on the nature of existence and humanity’s place in the cosmos. These moments spurred me to solve the game’s 100+ puzzles in search of answers, and I’m largely satisfied with what I discovered.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set hundreds of years after its 2014 predecessor, The Talos Principle, you awaken in a utopian civilization as its 1000th – and final – sentient robot resident. Following mankind’s extinction due to a global virus centuries prior, intelligent machines designed by a brilliant scientist have inherited the Earth. As the sum of all human knowledge, these machines have resigned themselves to living within a single, modest city with strict population, exploration, and consumption limits to avoid repeating humanity’s mistakes. However, these beliefs are flipped on their heads when a mysterious entity taking the form of the Greek titan Prometheus beckons the machines towards a mysterious island with a pyramid-like megastructure, towers, and, of course, puzzles. You join a small expedition to discover the island’s origin and purpose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the puzzles being the stars, I enjoyed The Talos Principle II’s focus on storytelling and character development, highlighted by choice-driven conversations that do a great job of emphasizing the machines’ inherited sense of humanity. I became invested in getting to know my crew, such as two close friends with opposing yet valid viewpoints on how society should advance or having more lighthearted chats with a resident unsure of whether or not to keep its surfer-style speech pattern. Decisions influence the city’s direction and your standing in ways you won’t see for hours, and while I found the outcomes to be adequately satisfying, some optional threads, such as choosing whether or not to join an Illuminati-style secret group, don’t always lead to an impactful payoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6slinvkF0Rs" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless, The Talos Principle II presents many angles on important topics and leaves it up to its cast and players to decide what they believe. Fascinating philosophical concepts on the morality and responsibility of being an intelligent entity in a chaotic universe, numerous lore notes and audio logs, and even the city’s social media feed had me reconsidering my biases and beliefs in enriching and enlightening ways, even if I didn’t always agree. I’m still mulling over a log’s musings over humanity’s puzzling attitudes on natural extinction versus human-made extinction.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like that the game doesn’t prop any viewpoint as the “correct” one, and it doesn’t need to; the point is that you should ask such questions to see things from as many angles as possible, and players will draw their own conclusions to determine one of the story’s several endings. A plethora of dialogue choices does an admirable job of letting players express several potential perspectives, while the plot is an engaging and insightful mystery boasting neat twists and heavy revelations.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like the first game, placing crystal refractors to direct light beams around obstacles to the correct lock(s) to open the exit is the core puzzle-solving experience. New mechanics add exciting and creative layers while eliminating the annoying death-dealing hazards, such as bombs and turrets, from the last game. New tools include a device that creates portals on certain surfaces, an anti-gravity machine that lets players (and objects) stand on walls and ceilings, and a refractor that inverts light colors, among others. Each tool is a treat to work with alone, but the game soars highest when challenging you to use several in concert.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puzzle-solving is still a tricky exercise of placing, moving, and/or stacking objects in the correct spots or sequence, a process thankfully expedited by speedy player movement. Still, lengthier puzzles require a lot of running around to rearrange things, which sometimes wore on me. The final puzzle is the worst offender, as it requires a tedious amount of back-and-forth trekking to execute such a precise order of operations that slipping up often meant restarting the whole thing from scratch. Despite these headaches, I was consistently impressed with how developer Croteam managed to concoct so many well-thought-out puzzle rooms, and solving them never stopped feeling like a well-earned achievement.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/16/2798cc2f/talos_2_lasers.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/16/356d50be/talos_2_beach.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/16/52bacef8/talos_2_bridge.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/16/7340e36b/talos_2_robots.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/16/2f3b49a8/talos_2_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/25/f9b798a4/talosprinciple2_lasers.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the last game, there’s no hint system, but you can skip puzzles entirely by spending a collectible resource. The catch is that finding these helpful tokens is a task in itself, as they’re hidden throughout the open areas. I don’t mind this as someone too stubborn to skip unless a puzzle is truly mind-boggling, and it gave me another excuse to explore, but it does create more work for those eager to move on and see the rest of the narrative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biodiverse island is broken up into four cardinal regions composed of three smaller open hubs, each sporting eight primary puzzles plus optional riddles and collectibles. I enjoyed roaming these expansive regions between puzzles in search of smaller rewards such as lore notes, ancient human tech, or secret laboratories containing tantalizing secrets. The worlds also look quite nice despite frequent geometry pop-in. Though an overhead compass provides some guidance on how to find points of interest, the lack of a proper map made revisiting some destinations more of a chore than I would have liked. Environmental puzzles, such as rerouting an island-wide light beam or chasing hidden particle clouds to statues, offer neat side diversions and welcomed breaks from the critical path. The other major recurring puzzle comes in the form of assembling bridges by correctly rotating and connecting giant Tetrinomo pieces, though this exercise lost its luster after a few hours.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Talos Principle II is a long game, perhaps to a fault. I clocked in around 34 hours, and despite my generally consistent enthusiasm, I was ready to see the end before it hit me with another round of puzzles or a story-focused exploration segment. It’s an ambitious and ultimately well-made package with many social, artistic, and scientific ideas that I’ll be thinking about for the foreseeable future, long after the solution to its final riddle has faded from memory. That enlightenment makes The Talos Principle II’s challenges worth the effort. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The original Super Mario RPG, released for Super Nintendo in 1996, felt like it was meant to be your first RPG. In an era when Final Fantasy tried its best to tell mature stories within the medium's limitations and Dragon Quest demanded hours and hours of your time, Mario’s adventure felt much brighter and more manageable. Familiar characters, a lighthearted story, a reasonable length, and timed button-pressing during combat made it stand out against the competition. Revisiting the game more than 25 years later in this new remade shape shows the original formula did not need much tweaking to deliver an engaging and enjoyable journey. Super Mario RPG is not entirely innocent of the sins of video games past, but old fans will relish the chance to see the game in a new light, and I’m confident newcomers will find something to love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond the fun combat, visuals, and story, the best part of Super Mario RPG is that it is incredibly bizarre. The Nintendo of 1996 was still figuring out the rules of Mario’s universe, and as a result, developer Square (not yet Square Enix) was able to create characters and put Mario in positions his parent company would likely never agree to today. The remake, thankfully, maintains all of that weirdness. I didn’t find anything salacious or offensive, but there are entire races of characters that we have never seen again in the Mario universe, Shy Guys have full conversations, and some dialogue choices make Mario come off as a jerk. In one scene, a party member has to hold Mario back from punching a child Toad who casually insulted him. I am grateful the game has not been sanitized and is still full of admittedly inconsequential references to other franchises and Nintendo games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is also still quite funny. It never reaches the comedic heights of its spiritual successors like Paper Mario or Mario &amp;amp; Luigi, but I chuckled often. Mario’s primary means of communication is jumping to prove he is actually Mario, and every time I pressed the jump button to move the conversation forward; I appreciated the commitment to the bit. Outside of the comedic moments, the actual plot is perfunctory, with few, if any, emotional moments, but I was still eager to see where I was going and who I was going to meet next. Added in-engine character introduction moments and the occasional pre-rendered cutscene help deliver the story in new ways, but I am disappointed that the whole game doesn’t feature the same visual fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;As it was in the past, combat is a highlight, and the additions for the remake improve the action without detracting from what made it fun to begin with. A new Action Gauge fills as you successfully pull off Action Commands (the timed button-pressing) across battles, and when full, you can pull off powerful and flashy Triple Moves. I went out of my way to try every party combination to see all of them and enjoyed tracking how high I could get my Action Command Chain across battles. One shortcoming, however, is pulling off Action Commands isn’t always clear beyond seeing your chain number ticked up. Subsequent games inspired by Mario RPG’s combat, like 2023’s Sea of Stars, have done a better job at iterating on this system and offering better feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of what has changed about Super Mario RPG for the remake beyond the visuals is behind the scenes. The pace is brisker, and my hour count (even after beating the big optional boss) came in lower than the average playtime of the original. The game has been tweaked only slightly to add some new mechanics and make the adventure even more welcoming than it already was. The result is an experience that only shows its age slightly and rewards longtime fans and newcomers alike.&lt;/p&gt;

      Teen
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Persona 5 has become its own sort of mini-franchise within the Persona series. With many spin-off titles released over the years, such as Persona 5 Strikers, Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight, and Persona Q2: New Cinema Labyrinth, Atlus seems to love using Persona 5’s popularity to explore new stories and gameplay ideas. However, I applaud Atlus for making all of these spin-offs in completely different genres from each other. The latest, Persona 5 Tactica, delivers an entertaining story, a colorful cast of characters, and fun combat mechanics within the context of a strategy RPG. Longtime Phantom Thieves can look forward to an enjoyable side adventure, but its uneven pacing and low enemy variety hold it back from being a true revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persona 5 Tactica’s story follows the core roster of characters from the original RPG. After finding themselves sucked into an alternate dimension, the group teams up with Erina, the local leader of the Rebel Corps, who wants to liberate citizens from the oppressive rule of the Legionnaires. Toshiro Kusakabe, an amnesiac politician from the real world, also somehow gets swept into the conflict. Their unknown connections to this alternate dimension have enough mystery to keep them interesting throughout the game. As the Phantom Thieves search for a way back home, the antagonists’ motivations intertwine with the origins of these newly introduced characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z5aBbuInWvs" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The camaraderie between the cast members can be seen through optional conversations that naturally unlock as you progress through the story. Scenes like these are fun side conversations that allow characters’ personalities to shine, such as Erina’s natural leadership skills after a scene where she feels like a liability, or Ryuji’s role as the comic relief character when a treasure chest he’s seeking turns out to be useless villain-branded merchandise. Viewing these talks also gives the party members GP, which are skill points to be allocated to learn new abilities, so there’s a useful gameplay incentive too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These conversations are bright and fun to listen to, thanks to the game’s excellent voice acting and art direction. The presentation style is more in line with an exaggerated cartoon style like Persona Q2’s rather than the more realistic proportions like in the original game and Strikers. This helps give Tactica a more lighthearted feel to balance out its darker themes, including illness, death, and trauma. The Persona series is also well known for its music, and Tactica’s soundtrack doesn’t disappoint. The soaring vocals and electrifying guitars will have your head bumping as the Phantom Thieves and Rebel Corp overthrow dictators in battle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tactica’s combat is more similar to XCOM than Fire Emblem in terms of strategic battles. Your team of three characters can hide behind cover and gain either partial cover, which drastically decreases incoming enemy damage, or full cover, which provides complete immunity. Tactica cleverly utilizes Persona 5’s main battle mechanics to fit the strategy genre. The most impressive implementation is the franchise’s signature “1 More” mechanic. In Tactica, instead of hitting enemy weaknesses or scoring a critical hit to trigger an additional turn, any unit on the field that isn’t behind cover becomes vulnerable. Being able to chain multiple 1 More turns and extending my movement range each time replicates the same sense of accomplishment that I felt when triggering multiple 1 More turns in the main game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 1 More mechanic is even more important when it comes to the game’s side quests. These side quests have restrictions, such as only being allowed to use certain characters or having to complete the battle under a fixed number of turns. I found these to be challenging but also incredibly fun, as they commanded me to think much more strategically than standard story missions. The side missions where I was required to beat them in only one turn were exhilarating.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/3ab6c10f/p5t7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/e6f598bd/p5t5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/d9ec979a/p5t8.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/af053e62/p5t6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/7a6bc6c8/p5t9.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/ddd71845/p5t10.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/8b000f54/p5t2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/10/6f3d2aa8/p5t3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;I had to activate as many 1 More turns as I possibly could while also trying to keep my teammates in a triangle formation. Triangulating on a downed enemy activates Triple Threat, which is Tactica’s version of the RPG’s All-Out-Attacks, where enemies caught in the blast receive massive damage. Mastering these techniques to come out on top of these challenging side missions is rewarding, and they come with an equally amazing prize: Completing them nets you 20 GP as opposed to 2 or 3 when viewing conversations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the gameplay suffers from uneven pacing when it comes to introducing new mechanics. This is especially true during the first 10 hours; you don’t receive the powerful follow-up mechanic until the second chapter. I’m confused as to why these highly effective attacks, which let teammates attack an extra time if you knock an enemy off a higher place, weren’t introduced earlier, as that would’ve kept the early hours fresh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enemy variety is also sorely lacking. Much of the time, you end up facing regular enemies with guns that don’t have any special traits to them. There’s also a bigger enemy that can only be downed if you hit it twice. Aside from some unique boss mechanics towards the end of a chapter, new enemy types are introduced sparingly. Enemy variety does improve later on, but not quick enough; it’s usually only a single new one per chapter. As a result, it’s boring to simply go through the motions when you’re repeatedly fighting the same kind of enemies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Persona 5 Tactica is a fun time for someone who’s looking for a more casual strategy game. The Phantom Thieves are just as charming as ever, and the newly introduced characters mesh well with them. It’s not an essential experience in the same way that Persona 5 Strikers was, but fans who aren’t tired of Persona 5 yet will find plenty to like with Tactica.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Call of Duty cycles through its lineup of villains on a yearly basis. Sometimes it's Nazis, other times it's Russian nationalists or zombies. But the most dangerous threat is one without a lust for brains or access to weapons of war; it's stagnation. And while many Call of Duty teams often switch up just enough variables to stave off monotony, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III fully submits to the annual churn.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
The campaign embodies this, as it rushes to a conclusion with little care for the details. COD missions usually follow a predictable yet mostly effective formula of packing together various one-off gameplay mechanics through fluctuating levels of intensity. Modern Warfare III cuts out necessary buildup and most of the variety, leading to basic stages riddled with pacing issues. Many max out at around 15 minutes, which means the usual rollercoaster of ups and downs has been stripped down to only include the descents. The spectacles are also less bombastic, and the abbreviated journey to them only further diminishes their appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHDEDDrGYvo" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speeding ahead also impedes the storytelling since it barrels through beats at an astonishing clip. How Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II’s antagonist is alive and why they’re now an ally was haphazardly glossed over in a cutscene from a previous multiplayer season. Vital details like that are just more casualties of its hurried pacing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While much of the campaign poorly emulates what COD has already done, the wider Open Combat missions attempt to take that blueprint into new territory. However, the promise of more agency is undone by how shallow these stages are. Exploring these larger levels is not worthwhile as unlocking new guns is often redundant. Upgrades and weapons also don’t carry forward between missions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives can be tackled in different ways, but these options don’t go far beyond going loud or sneaking through using rudimentary stealth mechanics. Static mission and map design, limited interactivity, and a lack of meaningful rewards deflate their intended replayability and mean one run is more than enough. Nonlinearity is novel here, but novelty alone is not enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MWIII’s multiplayer modes more clearly flex COD’s signature smooth gunplay and impressive sound design, but are not exempt from the malaise that affects the whole experience. Lower score thresholds and more agile movement mean competitive multiplayer matches have a faster tempo that’s still kept in check by the higher time-to-kill. This cadence allows for thrilling firefights, but time spent out of combat is a drag. Earning all the same gear each year is already a tiring process made even more laborious by MWIII’s grindy unlock system and busy menus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Competitive multiplayer, while familiar, highlights at least many of the series’ strengths, but the Zombies mode can’t even shamble over that low bar. Turning Zombies into an extraction shooter waters down the formula since success now requires multiple matches. The high difficulty means players must repeatedly drop in and acquire better gear before moving forward. The process is slow and tedious and full of uneventful loot runs and, if killed, lost progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zombies feels more like a limited-time Warzone event cobbled together from existing ideas and assets and that sentiment permeates throughout MWIII. Each pillar is an inferior patchwork of past ideas from its stunted campaign to its multiplayer that, while the strongest mode, is comprised of systems lifted wholesale from MWII with maps from 2009’s Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2. This year’s COD is a threadbare expansion masquerading as a sequel and an embarrassing way to mark the series’ 20th anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Everyone 10+
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;When the original Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl came out in 2021, it was a relatively bare-bones experience, but those bones were solid. Despite lacking many single-player modes, items, and even character voices, the core gameplay was good enough to keep the game afloat until it received refinements via online updates over the next two years. Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2, however, comes packaged with all those improvements and more. Developer Fair Play Labs has learned its lessons, and while the game isn't without its faults, it's a more-than-worthy follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 starts you off with 25 characters, which is the same amount currently available in its predecessor if you include DLC. A surprisingly large number of characters do not return for the second entry, however; only 14 fighters return, meaning 11 were replaced. If one of your favorites was cut, you have every right to be disappointed, but it's a blessing as well. For one, notable exceptions from the first game, like Squidward and Jimmy Neutron, are included here. A new roster also means the team at Fair Play has more opportunities to be creative with character mechanics, and the game feels more novel, even though the basic gameplay is similar.&lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/06/4c9afe00/nasb2_squidward.png" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p&gt;Luckily for All-Star Brawl 2, its strongest elements are its core combat mechanics. All the side content in the world means nothing if the game doesn't feel good to play in its most basic modes, so it's a good thing the franchise still feels great. Movement is quick and precise, powerful attacks are satisfying to land and devastating to absorb, and a new slime meter raises the skill ceiling higher than before. Fair Play has struck a successful balance between depth and approachability.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This balance is exemplified in the slime meter system. As you play a match, your meter &lt;a&gt;slowly increases&lt;/a&gt;, and by holding one of the triggers, you can spend that meter on a variety of actions. You can make attacks stronger, cancel attacks, make your shield last longer, or use a slimeburst to halt your momentum and save yourself from flying offscreen. For casual players, however, the slime meter will probably only ever be used when it hits maximum level, at which point you can unleash an ultimate move. &lt;a&gt;These character-specific, cinematic attacks &lt;/a&gt;are only lethal when your opponent is at a high damage level, making for exciting finishes to matches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the slime meter allows for more complex high-level play, I would have liked some more comprehensive tutorials to help newcomers reach that level. There's a "how to play" section tucked away in the single-player tab in the menu that gives a good overview of the basic mechanics, but more complicated maneuvers (like some slime skills) are reduced to quick text boxes you click through. Character-specific tutorials for some mechanics would have been appreciated as well, but you can always pause the game and see move descriptions in the "movesets" section.&lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/06/26c6bd1d/nickelodeon_all-star_brawl_2_danny_phantom.png" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p&gt;The biggest new feature All-Star Brawl 2 introduces is a campaign mode. Because of a dastardly plot helmed by &lt;em&gt;Danny Phantom&lt;/em&gt; villain Vlad Plasmius, the universe is doomed to explode. Luckily, Clockwork (also from &lt;em&gt;Danny Phantom&lt;/em&gt;) sucks Spongebob into a hub outside time and space, allowing him to journey through a series of levels to defeat Plasmius, with Clockwork rewinding time if you fail. The narrative itself is nonsensical and frustrating, frequently undermining achievements the player makes by pulling the rug out from under them and immediately inventing a new problem. It ultimately didn't ruin the campaign, though, because it takes up a relatively small amount of the experience, and the gameplay itself is shockingly fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Structurally, it's a roguelite. Runs are divided into three areas which you navigate via a series of paths in a menu screen. Activities vary by level, with some having you face off against henchmen from various Nickelodeon shows, and others having you pop balloons or complete platforming challenges. You can also fight mind-controlled versions of characters from the game's roster, gaining the ability to play as them in future runs if you succeed. Finally, each area is capped with a boss, like Sartana of the Dead or Shredder. These battles are hit or miss; late-game bosses are oddly much easier thanks to their simpler stages and general lack of movement – The Flying Dutchman, a boss from the first area, consistently gave me the most trouble.&lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/06/7322ce04/nickelodeon_all-star_brawl_2_plasmius.png" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p&gt;You can also unlock various upgrades from Professor Wakeman in the hub world, granting you extra lives, opportunities to heal, and better upgrades from shopkeepers mid-run. By the time I reached the end, I had an absolutely busted Azula build where most attacks poisoned foes and healed me. It's an incredibly satisfying power crawl. And even though the narrative falls completely flat overall, I enjoyed interacting with various shopkeepers along my runs, including Mrs. Puff, Hugh Neutron, and the Cabbage Merchant from &lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender&lt;/em&gt;. Each playable character has unique dialogue with each shopkeeper and boss, and it's fun to play as different characters to see how they interact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2 is a successful second attempt at the groundwork laid by its predecessor. Fair Play delivers a solid platform fighter that simultaneously improves the franchise's core mechanics and introduces side content to flesh out the overall package. It's nothing mind-blowing, and it's certainly not the next Super Smash Bros., but it's engaging, exciting, and worth your time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As far as pitches go, &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2023/08/23/crime-family-reunion" target="_blank"&gt;Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name&lt;/a&gt;, the next game in what used to be called the Yakuza series, is hard to beat: Find out what happened to series protagonist Kiryu Kazuma between &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/yakuza_6_the_song_of_life/b/playstation4/archive/2018/04/17/yakuza-6-the-song-of-life-game-informer-review.aspx" target="_blank"&gt;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review-a-new-hero-takes-his-turn" target="_blank"&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/a&gt;. The former ended with Kiryu faking his death to keep his adopted family of orphans safe. The idea was his story was over – he was moving on to the next chapter of his life. Developer &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/feature/2022/11/24/the-future-of-ryu-ga-gotoku-studio" target="_blank"&gt;Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio&lt;/a&gt; pitched it as such. Until the latter, when he showed back up, playing a large part in a game that was supposed to, and somewhat did, launch new series protagonist Ichiban Kasuga into the limelight. For the most part, Gaiden is an interesting bridge between those two games – even if it doesn't always go as deep into Kiryu's character as I hoped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, Kiryu was a secret agent for all those years. Following the events of Yakuza 6, Kiryu, now called Joryu, made a deal with the Daidoji, a secret organization with its hands seemingly in every part of Japan – from the underworld to the upper echelons of the government. Because the Daidoji helped stage Kiryu's death, he's now the group's errand boy, acting as muscle by beating the holy hell out of anyone he's instructed to. Until he gets involved in a hodgepodge of various conspiracies that ultimately lead to him helping disband the Omi and Tojo yakuza groups – a plot point Like a Dragon players may remember.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaiden's story is in line with the quality we've come to expect from RGG's titles, which is to say, it's very well-told and gripping. I like the noir slant on what is often fantastical crime dramas, and Daidoji's role in Japan makes it easy to buy into the plot's more spectacular moments. And I especially like the way the back third of the game mixes in with Like a Dragon, even having you play through some of the events of that game. Hilariously, though, despite going to great pains to remind the player over and over that Kiryu is dead, just about everyone sees through his disguise; no one buys this Joryu front. Kiryu, always a lovable idiot, commits to the bit to the very end, but you spend large swaths of the game listening to the same conversations about how people thought Kiryu died and Kiryu telling them he doesn't know what they're talking about – he's Joryu.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/22/ef06317a/combat04.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/22/4a75630c/casino.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/22/950b370d/combat02.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/22/7b560449/combat03.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/22/6e520807/cabaret.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/22/2c96098e/combat06.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/22/0ba2c49c/combat13.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Where the story falters is being a satisfying bridge between Yakuza 6 and Like a Dragon. On one hand, I now know what Kiryu was up to – spy stuff. On the other hand, the reason he faked his death in the first place often feels like an afterthought. There are conversations gesturing towards Kiryu's adopted family, but we don't get a ton of time to examine the psychological impacts his staged death has had on him as a character; I never really got the sense that he was filled with sorrow or regret for having lived a life that got him to this point. That is until the ending, which is one of the best and most affecting in the entire series, but it would've been nice to see more of that paid off throughout the game rather than backloaded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Gaiden returns to the series' trademark brawler combat, and it has satisfying twists on the formula in line with Kiryu's new job. There are two fighting styles: Yakuza and Agent. Yakuza plays similarly to other RGG games – you punch, kick, and beat up anything in your way. Agent is a faster but weaker combat stance, but with the addition of cool spy tools. – including an exploding cigarette, drones, and a cord that can tie up enemies. I like swapping between the two fighting styles. For example, starting with the Agent style to tie up and throw enemies around was great for crowd control and building up my special meter to unleash heavy attacks. After thinning the herd, I'd often switch to the Yakuza style to focus my powerful attacks on stronger enemies. It's a layer of strategy I don't feel like many other RGG games have had, which are often fun but mindless.&lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/22/c8327b7b/legendaryfighterspack.jpg" alt="Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name" title="Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name" typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p&gt;One last welcome change to the overall formula is how substories play out. At the risk of alienating the Yakuza fanbase, I've never been a fan of the wacky side stories in these games; I always want to keep the dramatic main story going. But the series often forced these diversions down your throat by making them automatically trigger out in the open world; it's no exaggeration to say that in older games, this could happen five or six times on a short walk to an objective, depending on your route. Gaiden introduces Akame, a new character who is sort of like Kiryu's manager. Most substories are now accessed through her rather than stumbled upon in the open world. It's a small touch, but one I welcomed with my entire heart. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At only 14 to 15 hours, Gaiden is a fun, comparatively short return to the world of Kiryu "Joryu" Kazuma. By the time credits roll, Gaiden neatly establishes Kiryu's role in the next mainline game, &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth" target="_blank"&gt;Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&lt;/a&gt;, and since that game's out in a few months, the brief taste gave me plenty to be excited for. I wish the story were more interested in exploring who Kiryu is now that he's forced into this double life, but as a thin bridge between games, Gaiden is a neat one. And I'll always appreciate an excuse to hit the streets and the thugs therein with my favorite dummy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;RoboCop: Rogue City is likely the best game the action hero has ever starred in. That bar isn’t tough to hurdle, but the adventure delivers plenty of thrills for fans to be excited about. This narrative-driven first-person shooter has a loving reverence for the films and a good understanding of its protagonist, swinging for the fences with a lengthy original story, fun references, and plenty of enjoyably cheesy humor. Unfortunately, like the franchise’s vision of Detroit, Rogue City is very rough around the edges, resulting in a flawed hero but one that’s ultimately entertaining to patrol with. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set between the events of RoboCop 2 and 3, the titular cyborg formerly known as Alex Murphy finds himself pulled in all directions. A mysterious figure known as “The New Guy” has arrived to rally Detroit's top gangs to wreak havoc for an unknown sinister purpose. The police department is pressed under the thumb of Omni Consumer Products’ (OCP) supremely unlikable corporate stooge Max Becker, who views RoboCop and the police as ineffective relics of the past. Myriad of smaller threads vie for RoboCop’s attention, such as a snooping journalist seeking your aid in exposing OCP secrets, therapy sessions with a doctor looking to learn what makes you tick, and a new rookie partner who’s also an OCP informant among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By and large, the game does a good job of tying these threads into an entertaining and cohesive story full of twists and turns. Although the 20-hour adventure overstays its welcome by the last act with several red herrings and false endings, Rogue City is a better RoboCop 3 than the movie RoboCop 3. It’s fun to hear actor Peter Weller reprise his role as RoboCop, and while the other performances are decent at best, the character models and animations are as robotic as RoboCop himself. Lip-syncing is especially bad, and it outright breaks in several scenes, giving everyone the appearance of communicating via telepathy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/js5-tZhlqpA" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Roaming the explorable police station between missions or open hubs such as downtown leads to side missions that place RoboCop in bizarre, entertaining scenarios with Detroit’s finest weirdos. Whether solving a murder on a sunscreen commercial set, clearing boombox-blasting hooligans away from a storefront, or doing the “Robot Dance” at the request of a child, you could tell me these tasks are just thinly veiled vehicles for RoboCop to deliver delightfully dopey one-liners, and I would be okay with that. Rogue City doesn’t take itself totally seriously, capturing the first film's dark satire and the sequels' campy goofiness that, while not always hitting the mark, manage to work in a fun way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choice-driven dialogue presents opportunities to present yourself as a strict enforcer who obeys the law no matter what or a more empathetic, nuanced hero. Some choices do a good job of capturing the drama of RoboCop, a black-and-white do-gooder confronting moral shades of grey, like choosing to support one of two morally questionable mayoral candidates or committing illegal corporate espionage for supposed public good. Decisions steer the story and characters in different ways that funnel into multiple endings that feel adequately paid off, like helping an unhoused drug addict and informant find self-value or the journalist deciding whether or not to expose your technical struggles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fighting crime often involves powerfully marching down corridors and back alleys to mow down scores of idiot thugs as they unleash hails of bullets at you. Rogue City succeeds in making you feel like the human tank RoboCop is. You can’t duck or take cover and don’t need to; he’s durable enough to absorb dozens of bullets, and I loved popping off headshots while confidently marching through incoming fire as targets panicked in disbelief. Other times, I got a kick out of grabbing foes and flinging them across rooms. I felt powerful but not invincible; in tougher firefights, which usually means higher enemy numbers and more powerful artillery, rationing a small inventory of health packs became a challenging trial. This rings most true during big boss battles against familiar RoboCop adversaries, which veer into unfair territory due to their fast and relentless offense versus your comparatively limited mobility. &lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/02/2c9e841e/robocop_roguecity_3.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p&gt;In addition to RoboCop’s signature sidearm, which sports unlimited ammo, the weapon arsenal is by-the-numbers and hit-and-miss in terms of the punch they pack. Automatic weapons feel good, but shotguns and sniper rifles pale in comparison. Enemy A.I. is also dumb as rocks. Foes often stand in place, inconsistently go for cover, get snagged in geometry, or, in rare instances, kill each other. I laughed out loud watching two motorcycle-riding goons accidentally collide with each other during one confrontation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the action delivers solid thrills in a basic meat-and-potatoes way. Everything works just well enough to provide a good time. Plus, several environments are highly destructible, adding spectacle to battles. Rogue City may not fully deliver in terms of polish or ambition, but it provides a potent, if repetitive, satisfaction in blasting goons as they explode into gory showers of blood, limbs, and brains. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earning skill points to slot into various traits, such as Combat, Armor, Engineering, and Deduction, add unique perks that spice up combat and exploration. My favorite perks include buffing my armor to the point that some bullets ricochet off, killing their senders. An engineering perk let me brute force my way into safes I’d otherwise have to find combinations for. One neat combat perk let me perform trick shots off certain surfaces to eliminate targets behind cover. Various chipboards of increasing complexity, in which you create paths to passive perks by slotting different nodes while avoiding hitting debuffs, help improve general performance, but re-slotting nodes into every new board became a tiresome exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/02/2506b00d/robocop_rogue_city_5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/11/02/4ad70b56/robocop_rogue_city_4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/24/3959ae98/robocop_rogue_city_murphy_1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/08/24/a2a1a96c/robocoprc_murphy_and_lewis.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Outside of battle, you engage in detective work by scanning crime scenes for clues, collecting evidence, and questioning suspects. The process is streamlined – just scan highlighted objects until RoboCop and pals make a breakthrough, like opening a new dialogue option for interrogations – but these segments are nice breaks that mix up the gameplay while highlighting the character’s less-murdery talents. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RoboCop’s recurring glitches are a primary plot device, but technical bugs became a real hindrance for the game. Enemies have a habit of sinking into floors or phasing through walls, complicating combat encounters. Cutscenes sometimes have pixelated transitions from scene to scene, and texture pop-in abounds. Bad audio mixing means some characters speak way too loudly while others sound normal. The game failed to recognize when I fulfilled an objective a couple of times, forcing me to reload a save and play the section again. Late game, certain guns fired automatically before I pulled the trigger, wasting ammo. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully, updates will stamp out these issues because RoboCop: Rogue City provides a respectable adventure that feels like a long-lost shooter of the early 2010s in mostly good ways. Admittedly, the license carries the game through its rougher patches; if you’re not a RoboCop fan, the adventure may feel dated or buggy compared to other shooters. But as a B-tier love letter to the tin man in blue, Rogue City is a nice return to the limelight for Alex Murphy. &lt;/p&gt;

      Nintendo
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Ever since its first title 20 years ago, the WarioWare franchise has shapeshifted to take advantage of the capabilities and gimmicks of whatever the current Nintendo platform was. But the first entry on Switch, Get It Together, bucked that trend, putting you in control of the actual cast of characters in platforming-style microgames instead of taking advantage of the Switch’s unique traits. WarioWare: Move It aligns more with the traditional WarioWare experience, resulting in a better overall collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Move It takes the core tenants of the WarioWare franchise and cranks them up to 11. Players must learn various forms using two individual Joy-Con controllers, then complete rapid-fire microgames – three-to-five-second minigames that rely on your on-the-fly reactions to complete. As you progress through a session, the difficulty of each game and the speed at which they fly at you increases, creating an ever more frantic experience.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="subhead-aside"&gt;First Things First&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WarioWare: Move It lets you play through various microgames using two Joy-Con controllers. If you’re like me, you haven’t used the Joy-Con wrist straps since you opened your Switch. That means the first thing you will need to do is find the wrist straps for your Joy-Cons, as several forms and microgames require them for specific actions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I love the diversity of microgames on display. One second, I’m holding my arms out, clanking drinks with people at a party, then a moment later, I’m holding my Joy-Cons like an umbrella to protect a woman from getting soaked in a rainstorm before raising my arms to pick a giant nose. The irreverent humor fans have come to expect is in full effect with Move It, as is the creativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forms allow you to properly position yourself for the upcoming minigame, but some are less developed than others. The “Hand Model” pose is confusing, as you must drop one Joy-Con, then move the other to the now-empty hand to pull off gestures with the other hand; even after completing the story mode, I still struggled to position myself correctly for this form in time thanks to the rapid-fire structure. It’s disappointing this form is so complicated to set up since several of my favorite microgames are a part of it. Another one, “Ba-KAW,” has you pose like a chicken and features the broadest mix of excellent and frustrating games. However, my least favorite activity is a long-form boss level that involves flipping steaks; I failed multiple times because it doesn’t consistently register unless you make overly exaggerated motions timed to when the meat is moving by you on a conveyor belt.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/aa8d4d91/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_06_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/061263d2/switch_wwmoveit_scrn_15.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/20e5d557/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_07_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/17c71d31/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_05_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/97446264/switch_wwmoveit_scrn_14.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/58bd96f3/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_09_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/9401dd79/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_08_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/0e53ba00/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_10_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/a923f529/switch_wwmoveit_scrn_01.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/31cea0c7/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_01_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/a7e147f4/switch_wwmoveit_scrn_03.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/982081ba/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_02_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/1f0fd3d0/switch_wwmoveit_scrn_05.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/3223f61d/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_03_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/e3d21fec/switch_wwmoveit_scrn_11.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/31/baa06d59/switch_wariowaremoveit_scrn_04_png_jpgcopy.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, Move It’s library is full of oddball games I consistently looked forward to. On multiple occasions, I smirked or outright said, “That was so cool,” after experiencing a novel microgame for the first time. However, a few of them don’t quite land, as imprecise motion controls lead to frustrating failures, while others aren’t descriptive enough for you to reasonably understand what you need to do in the short window you have to do it. Thankfully, if you run out of hearts, you can continue by performing a “Sacred Pose,” which is essentially a goofy version of a yoga stance, to earn a continue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working through the hundreds of microgames is fun, but as always, it’s better with friends. WarioWare: Move It harkens back to one of the better entries in the series, the motion-controlled WarioWare: Smooth Moves for Wii. That entry was one of my go-to party games, and I had similar hopes for Move It.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cZEa9VXurTE" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, due to a couple of complicated forms and accuracy issues with some of the microgames, the core mode of Move It is a harder sell than its Wii predecessor, particularly for casual players. Thankfully, the multiplayer-focused Party Mode lets you perform simpler poses involving one Joy-Con at a slower pace in fun competitions. It’s silly and operates on the honor system, but my favorite involves completing microgames with added challenges like sitting on the floor or puffing out your cheeks while you play. Another puts you in the context of a board game, where winning microgames earns you dice rolls. These side modes are great for laughs and are the go-to way to play Move It in a group setting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following Get It Together and Game &amp;amp; Wario, Move It is the WarioWare game I’ve been waiting for over the last 15 years, and it mostly delivers. The motion-controlled madness gives you plenty of fun and novel experiences, even if a few stinkers are in the mix. Regardless of those, WarioWare: Move It’s catalog is full of microgames I look forward to revisiting for months to come.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Jusant asks players to do one thing: climb. As a silent mountaineer accompanied by a cute critter, the only thing standing between you and your mysterious mission is one very tall mountain. The journey to its summit is treacherous, but thanks to an ingenious climbing system, beautiful art direction, and intriguing world-building, inching toward the top is worth the effort.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch Our Jusant Review:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BS4FHDWxCIs" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intuitive climbing mechanics are the star of the show. Pressing the left and right shoulder buttons lets you grip handholds with the corresponding hands of the climber while you aim with the left stick. The back-and-forth rhythm of hitting both buttons to pull yourself up precarious terrain feels natural and realistic without being cumbersome. Gripping drains a stamina meter, and though managing this isn’t often difficult, it does add a nice element of thoughtfulness and tension to the ascent. Climbing excels, but simply walking can be troublesome as the character has a habit of getting stuck on even the most negligible geometry, such as small pieces of rubble, resulting in awkward jumping and spinning to break loose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your only tool is a retractable climbing rope that automatically anchors you to a wall, meaning you can never fall to your death (or die in general). While this contributes to the game’s relaxed, meditative atmosphere, that doesn’t mean failure isn’t a factor. Slipping sends you dangling back to where you began, which can result in having to reclimb lengthy stretches. You can prevent demoralizing setbacks by staking up to three pitons as you climb, extending your reach while creating makeshift checkpoints. I love the strategy of managing the placement of my pitons, as it gave me creative agency in how I navigated tricky sections – namely walls lacking handholds – while ensuring any lost progress was entirely my fault due to bad or infrequent piton staking. The rope also allows for performing fun maneuvers like swinging across gaps or wall-running to reach distant goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cGsY2dthctc" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballast, the climber’s cute, water-like pet, offers another helping hand. Hitting a button makes it emit a pulse that transforms organic elements, such as making giant flower bulbs sprout climbable buds or causing vines to grow rapidly and letting you hitch a free ride on them. There’s only a small handful of these tricks, but they complement traditional climbing while adding an entertaining layer of whimsy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These mechanics result in climbing that feels challenging in the right ways. Scaling the mountain requires enough physical effort and coordination combined with mindful planning to make hitting each elevation milestone feel like a well-earned accomplishment. Looking down over a cliff to see the entire section I just completed before looking up at the obstacles to come is satisfying and daunting. Climbing in games is often shades of being either mind-numbingly simplistic or&amp;nbsp;painfully tedious. Jusant strikes a great sweet spot. The superb controls made me confident and eager to tackle the well-crafted, puzzle-like climbing routes and&amp;nbsp;obstacles.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developer Don’t Nod does a great job of mixing up Jusant’s premise by introducing new environmental or platforming challenges in each of the game’s six chapters. One section has you riding powerful wind gusts to reach far-off platforms. Rock-like bugs serve as moving handholds that can carry the player along, provided you watch the path they're on and adjust if they lead you astray. One of my favorite areas lets you scale and swing across massive stalactites in a giant, bioilluminated cave. Jusant has a relatively short run time (about six hours), but it remains fresh and engaging throughout.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jusant’s picturesque scenery looks fantastic. Set in a world that has mysteriously lost nearly all traces of water, the mountain is situated in a dry, vast seabed. Dehydrated coral, fossilized seashells, and shipwrecked vessels provide the only evidence of the former ocean, as do numerous abandoned settlements where a lost society once called the mountain home. It may technically be a world in ruin, but the warm colors, great lighting, and sharp art design make it fun to look at.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/27/e628b404/jusant_vine.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/27/dbabc1bc/jusant_balast.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/27/5ebc49b1/jusant_grass.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/27/37bbd05b/jusant_hang.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/27/2357f7ad/jusant_cave.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;How this calamity happened, and the plight of the people who experienced it is told through a series of sometimes lengthy but fascinating diaries. Whether it was the story of a young woman eagerly abandoning her home life to embark on an expedition to the summit or the day-to-day musings of folks who can’t fathom living on a horizontal plane, these logs are enjoyable and worthwhile reads that provide vital context to the world and your quest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numerous paths inside and outside the mountain hide various collectibles and interactive artifacts, such as wall paintings telling a grand legend and seashells that provide audio-only flashbacks of this lost civilization. I went out of my way to find as many of these as possible, and thankfully, the game tracks all of them. That makes revisiting chapters to locate missed items an easy and inviting proposition. Even if you can’t collect it, I was happy to find new rooms, stores, and other infrastructure to get a better idea of these people’s way of life.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jusant is my favorite Don’t Nod title since the original Life is Strange and is one of the year’s best gems. The climbing mechanics are so smart and well-executed that I hope other games take notes. Add an inviting presentation, a pleasant soundtrack, and an alluring air of mystery and isolation reminiscent of Team Ico’s best works, and Jusant is a rewarding expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

              &lt;b&gt;Reviewed on:&lt;/b&gt;
      PlayStation 5
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Platform:&lt;/b&gt;
      PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt;
      EA Sports
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developer:&lt;/b&gt;
      EA Vancouver
      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rating:&lt;/b&gt;
      Mature
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;A target appears on your back when you’re a long-reigning champ. No longer the enigma you once were, contenders begin studying your body of work to figure out the path to ending your time at the top. The best way to fend off would-be challengers is to continually build and evolve. Developer EA Vancouver seems to understand this because while no legitimate contenders have emerged in the mixed-martial-arts genre, EA Sports UFC 5 retools several key areas to show the franchise isn’t resting on its laurels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like its predecessors, UFC 5 aptly captures the thrill of stepping into the Octagon. After thankfully truncated pomp and circumstance (gone are the grating pre-fight emotes from the last game), the fast-paced fistfighting had me on the edge of my seat until the final horn. I love that the licensed fighters are programmed to behave like their real-world counterparts, forcing you to solve a different puzzle with each new encounter. The action satisfies, particularly in striking battles, though the occasional glitched fighter, unnatural limb contortion, and awful camera swing break the immersion in frustrating ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Momentum is a key factor in the simplified grappling system, and longtime UFC players will need to retrain their brains to defend takedown attempts. Once on the ground, you choose the position or submission you want to pursue, and the game determines your success based on stamina, fighter attributes, and whether the defender acts properly. The resulting grappling exchanges can lead to awe-inspiring scrambles that are much more natural-looking than anything we've seen in the series before. On top of that, I do not miss the annoying submission minigames from the past UFC titles one bit.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/27/13110929/grappling_1j.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/27/ba1d6000/ufc5_screenshot_2.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/27/1b16968d/ufc5_screenshot_1.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/27/0a666c4a/ufc5_screenshot_5.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Sticking to your game plan is crucial. But in MMA, even the best-laid plans can disappear in the blink of an eye; I went into a fight with a kickboxer with the plan to take him down, tire him out, and submit him. However, I got caught by a knee to the face on a takedown attempt, changing the complexion of the fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each exchange has fight-ending or fight-altering potential, and the newly implemented Frostbite Engine does an exemplary job of showcasing the action. Scanned fighter models look incredible. Standing across the cage from a superstar like Israel Adesanya or Max Holloway is surreal, thanks to the intricate details that UFC 5 captures. Unfortunately, that means the gap in visual quality between the real fighters and the created fighters is immense; my created fighter looks like he was pulled from UFC 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UFC 5 is the first M-rated entry, allowing fighters to sustain more realistic damage. I loved seeing deeper cuts and more swelling develop during the firefights I found myself in. If things get too brutal, a doctor can even intervene to determine if the fight should continue. Thankfully, this is a rare occurrence; in my experience, fighters almost always succumbed to the damage before a doctor had to step in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The M-rating also means the trash talk and in-game cinematics have more authentic language. While I enjoy hearing fighters and coaches talk the way they do in real life, the in-game soundtrack feels like they went out of their way to include explicit songs to a tiresome extent, which is particularly noticeable as you spend so much time in menus during Career Mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Career Mode keeps the same basic format as the previous releases. Using a created fighter (or blank-slate licensed fighter), you work your way to the top of the UFC rankings with the ultimate goal of becoming the greatest of all time by breaking a set number of UFC records. You start with a low-stat archetype of your choosing, then develop them over the course of several in-game years. I love that throwing a lot of hooks in fights and training sessions develops your hooks while training with a real fighter lets you learn their signature moves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1R4MdobS1nI?start=3" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, over the course of a Career, the repetition sinks in fast. Sparring the same partners, tackling the same challenges, and navigating the same menus becomes a monotonous affair in the weeks leading up to your fight. You can simulate a lot of the sparring, but you might end up with worse benefits. Even outside of training, you take part in the same binary social media trash talk and menu-based activities. The mode doesn’t go nearly far enough to replicate the UFC’s personality-driven drama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I grew tired of the weekly grind after about 25 fights in Career. Thankfully, a suite of other modes allows you to jump right into the action. Online Career and Ranked Championship give you longer-term online experiences, but my favorite online mode is Blitz, where you compete in rapid-fire elimination tournaments. If you’d rather avoid the sometimes unstable online connections, you can keep the action offline by taking part in one-off fights with custom rulesets, creating your own events, or even playing curated fights based on real-world cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the launch roster has a few glaring omissions. While all the stars are there, a few highly ranked contenders and several up-and-coming prospects aren’t included, while various fighters who are no longer with the UFC are. I like having legacy fighters available, and EA Vancouver has a proven track record of post-launch updates, but it’s disappointing to be missing so many at release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with its shortcomings, EA Sports UFC 5 delivers an exciting MMA experience regardless of the mode in which you compete. Fighting your favorite UFC stars never gets old, and the adrenaline rush that comes with knocking your opponent out in a fierce back-and-forth battle makes it hard to resist the allure of stepping back into the Octagon for one more fight.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Alan Wake 2 Review - Back To Reality

      Mature
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Remedy is known for being experimental. It mixes live-action footage into its video games, plays with player expectations, rewards those devoted to the developer’s history and gameography, and in the case of Alan Wake 2, eagerly performs big-budget lunacy for our entertainment and sometimes confusion. The highs of Alan Wake’s follow-up adventure are tall, but there are frequent lows that drag the whole experience into The Dark Place. I also encountered a number of bugs that forced frequent restarts and one full reinstallation. But even in the moments I was most frustrated, I still admire Remedy’s commitment to creating a unique experience and embracing its weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Wake 2 takes place in the real amount of time since we played the original game. Alan has been stuck in limbo for 13 years, trying his hardest to write himself back to reality. From a zoomed-out perspective, both Alan Wake games are about a man trying to escape an evil entity. On closer inspection, however, the story is about the nature of art, what it means to create, the reliability of memory and reality, parenting, friendship, and of course, murder. Alan Wake 2’s story, sometimes clumsily, navigates all these topics with morose voiceover, beautiful visuals, impressive performances, and bizarre set pieces that will undoubtedly become the game’s primary talking point for the rest of its legacy. This is where Alan Wake 2 shines. The way it presents its story is different than just about everything out there, and even though I would have liked more interactivity during conversations and internal monologues, I remained consistently engaged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Game Informer's&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;Alan Wake 2 Review:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EXlL0FpztGY" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exception to this is new playable protagonist Saga’s investigative techniques. While I overall preferred playing as Saga to Alan, her special detective abilities led to frequent underwhelming reveals. Saga arrives at impossible-to-know case facts by simply sitting in a room and thinking to herself. I am happy to buy into the conceit that she has special powers, but from the player’s perspective, watching Saga just know things for no reason is deeply unsatisfying. Her interactive efforts to build evidence out on a wall also feel like painting by numbers, when you generally already know what image you are creating. Overall, however, Saga’s story and the mystery surrounding her family is the more interesting one, and I followed her threads when given the choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan lacks Saga’s investigative abilities, but playing his portions, which take place in the abstract Dark Place, have their own issues. Alan is supposed to be lost and confused in the Dark Place, and from a narrative perspective, it works. But when a location (and troublesome map) is already difficult to navigate and then filled with doors that change exits depending on the lighting, things get opaque in a way that isn’t consistently fun.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Even when lost and frustrated, however, combat can be a beacon of action-packed joy. Lighting up enemies with a flashlight and filling them with bullets feels more determined than in the 2010 game, but pulling off a perfect flashlight-shotgun combo still feels great. So great, in fact, that I wanted much more. There are few instances where you &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; fight enemies. Ammo is scarce and dodging is reliable, which means engaging is discouraged. Combat ends up feeling like a fantastic dessert when you are watching your calories. You want to partake, but you really shouldn’t. Thankfully, the penultimate confrontation throws plentiful ammo and enemies at you and serves as a fun homage to the original game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alan Wake 2 also leans into an irritating video game trope more so than any game in recent memory where everything always feels just out of reach in an unsatisfying way. You must go through this electronic door, but right as you walk up to it, the power goes out, and you must find items A, B, and C to get electricity flowing again. Variations of this happen constantly. Thematically, it makes sense that the story, which is being written as you progress, creates barriers to slow you down, but on a practical level, it feels antagonistic to the player, which is just annoying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been eagerly waiting for Alan’s return since the original game ended with a cliffhanger and 2012’s American Nightmare did little to move the story forward. I am narratively satisfied with the events of the game and enthusiastically welcome Saga into the world. But actually playing the game, navigating the world, and avoiding combat is where I stumbled. I was eager to see the next cutscene, but gameplay often fell short, and I fought more bugs than Taken enemies. For longtime Remedy fans and those who want to see what happens next for Alan Wake, the sequel is a success, but making it to the end includes unnecessary hurdles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The first Ghostrunner is one of my all-time favorite games, and I've been excited for its sequel, Ghostrunner 2, since its reveal more than two years ago. I didn't need much to be satisfied with another parkour venture into developer One More Level's cyberpunk dystopia; I just wanted more Ghostrunner. And when Ghostrunner 2 is doing what put its predecessor on the map – fast-paced first-person action-parkour gameplay – it shines. But a few new attempts at expanding this world, both narratively and mechanically, don't shine as bright, however interesting and admirable they are. Nonetheless, Ghostrunner 2, with its exceptional action, soundtrack, and beautifully oppressive world, kept me smiling in delight for most of my 15 hours. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first game ends with the titular Ghostrunner liberated from his A.I.-powered Cybervoid trappings under a new name, Jack, and humanity finally free within its last living city, the Dharma Tower. Ghostrunner 2 picks up one year later, with Jack living the hero life before discovering the Asura, a group of four mechanical beings intent on filling the power void to become its new leaders (with their own superhuman-esque creatures replacing humanity in the process). It's a fine setup, but it unfortunately begins with the worst boss fight in the game. The encounter is not bad but it pales compared to the significantly improved bosses Jack encounters later. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After taking the boss down, I meet up with the ragtag Interface Council, including Zoe from the first game and various other NPCs. Instead of talking to floating heads like in Ghostrunner, Jack returns to a homebase where he speaks with everyone in person. Interfacing with physical people is a nice touch and breathes life into Jack's otherwise mechanical existence, as do the traces of humanity, like humor, that Jack picks up on in conversations. Unfortunately, conversations lack the energy featured in the rest of the game, as Jack and whoever he speaks to, stand directly across each other while stilted but informative conversations play out. In this base, Jack can purchase new abilities for his kit and play through Roguerunner.exe, an optional but awesome roguelite experience that puts combat front and center. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/20/fc6d6b5b/ghostrunner_ii_review_screens2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/20/3718462f/ghostrunner_ii_review_screens12.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/20/59d20f11/ghostrunner_ii_review_screens1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/20/1cc4581f/ghostrunner_ii_review_screens13.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;After checking in with the base between most missions, Jack is quickly thrown back into the explosive action One More Level excels at, and it's always a treat. As techno percussion and synths mesh together to create an excellent score, I send Jack slashing enemies left and right with a katana, slowing down time in-air to dodge projectiles and deflect energy pelts back to their origin. Like the first game, Ghostrunner 2 also feels like a puzzle game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every arena can be mastered – jump here, grind left, wall-run forward, grapple up, slash enemy, deflect that enemy's bullet, throw a shuriken at that explosive barrel to take them out, then jump over this machine's energy blast and slash through it when the coast is clear. And that's just one puzzle solution to the enemies before you. Ghostrunner 2's action feels amazing because every potential solution unveils itself in what feels like the most optimal path; it's how I imagine a mechanical being like Jack feels when scanning the battleground. I wish my Ultimate and other abilities felt as intrinsic as the shuriken, but each is still good fun, even if I have to remind myself they exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those action-packed, puzzle-like moments are when Ghostrunner 2 is everything I want in a sequel and more. But the results are less consistent when One More Level introduces new mechanics. A new motorbike brings a somehow even more exciting dynamism to Ghostrunner 2's action – jumping off it to launch over a laser wall, then grappling back onto my bike after it safely passed through said wall never stopped being the coolest thing ever. I enjoyed most moments on this bike, but after a quick ride through Dharma Tower's neon-drenched cyberpunk city, most of the bike action happens in the less-interesting world outside the tower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love that One More Level showcased the outside world, especially after never leaving the tower in the first game. However, the post-apocalyptic desert wasteland is simply not as fun to explore as what's back inside, especially on foot. While this part of the world does give Jack a more open area to play in, that extra space tones down the excitement I feel inside the more constrained spaces of Dharma Tower (and it doesn't help the latter is more visually stimulating, too). It's worth mentioning, however, that this desert wasteland is home to one of my favorite boss fights of the year that left me shouting "no way" to myself throughout. Another addition is the wingsuit, and while using it in new parkour lines is fun, using it in combat feels like an unnecessary addition. Fortunately, it arrives late in the game and does little to affect the full experience. &lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/20/7dd31e65/ghostrunner_ii_review_screens6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/20/ffc0c644/ghostrunner_ii_review_screens7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/20/51bfee74/ghostrunner_ii_review_screens8.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;With Ghostrunner 2 behind me, I’m thrilled more of this series exists. Even after rolling credits, I'm excited to tear through its levels once more to find collectibles like sword and glove skins and old-world artifacts like VHS tapes, and try my hand some more at the delectably simple roguelite minigame. Though Ghostrunner 2 falters in a few ways, like its more open-ended sections and superfluous wingsuit, what remains in the hours outside of those missteps is its best-in-class parkour action. And like its predecessor, it remains a damn treat.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As a series that has been around for nearly four decades, Super Mario Bros. should have shown signs of slowing down years ago. But continuous thoughtful reinvention has helped the franchise remain a genre leader. Super Mario Bros. Wonder represents the next step of evolution, delivering the tight, tried-and-true gameplay in the context of the most creative 2D entry in nearly 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply platforming through a stage is often a pure delight; Mario and his large roster of friends have never felt, looked, or sounded better. A joyful soundtrack full of upbeat earworms I’ve been humming since I first turned on the game complements superb gameplay. And the new expressive art style accentuates the most important parts of the characters and world.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Watch Our Super Mario Bros. Wonder Review:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super Mario Bros. Wonder’s level design rarely disappoints. Each course introduces a new, creative gimmick. Whether it’s hippo-like creatures you can bounce off to reach new areas or circular rocks you must use to roll through lava while snatching collectibles, the perfectly designed on-ramps let me learn the new convention. However, the excitement of how the stage gimmick would evolve to its ultimate utilization always had me champing at the bit.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new power-ups, namely the Elephant Fruit, Drill Mushroom, and Bubble Flower, add fun and practical ways to explore each stage. However, the new Badge system is my favorite way to augment my character’s abilities. The Parachute Cap, which lets you glide, and the Sensor, which tells you when there’s a secret nearby, were helpful, but my favorite was always the Crouching High Jump, thanks to its wide-ranging utility.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Still, the key attractions were the eponymous Wonder Effects. These level-changing warps had me constantly guessing at what could possibly come next. I never knew if grabbing the Wonder Flower would transform Mario into one of Bowser’s minions, skyrocket him into an outer space obstacle course, or cause the entire stage to break out into song. Nintendo used this opportunity to install all-new gameplay mechanics like top-down sequences, slow-motion action, and fun chase sequences. I adore how unexpected each Wonder Effect is, even aiding the title’s less creative boss battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though there are only a few true boss fights in Super Mario Bros. Wonder, they use Wonder Effects to bring new twists. However, outside of these effects, which include changing the terrain, cloning enemies, and more, most battles are against the same character with the same move set. I appreciate how far the Wonder Effects go toward diversifying these confrontations, but I can’t help but wish for more variety in the encounters themselves. Thankfully, that’s not the case for the final battle, which will stick with me for a long time due to its uncompromised use of Wonder Effects in a creative and fun fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent most of my time in Super Mario Bros. Wonder solo, but I enjoyed the limited multiplayer offering. I’m disappointed by the lack of online cooperative play, but playing locally with friends is a blast and less chaotic than past games since characters can’t interact with each other (aside from riding on Yoshi).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JStAYvbeSHc?start=1" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can play online with friends, but you’re limited to forming a lobby where you appear as ghosts in separate instances; you revive each other, but that’s the extent of the interaction. You can also set up course races, where you see who makes it to the flagpole first, but while these challenges are enjoyable, they take away what makes Super Mario Bros. Wonder so good in the first place. My favorite moments in Super Mario Bros. Wonder came when I was taking my time finding secrets or enjoying Wonder Effects rather than speedrunning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super Mario Bros. Wonder surprises and delights from the moment you turn on the game. Though the gameplay feels familiar, Nintendo’s ability to iterate on the established formula in unique ways kept me on my toes throughout the journey all the way up to the memorable final battle. After all this time, I thought I had a grasp on the breadth of the tricks the 2D Mario series had up its sleeve, but that Super Mario Bros. Wonder so consistently surprised me speaks to just how much gas is left in the iconic franchise’s tank.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;In the technical world of city-builders, 2015’s Cities: Skylines made a name for itself as an uncompromising but delicate game where players needed to spin a variety of municipal plates to keep things in order across their fantasy cities. Eight years and millions of digital building permits later, Colossal Order has returned to construct a convincing sequel in Cities: Skylines II. The iterative additions don’t arrive without consequential imperfections, but Cities: Skylines II still boasts all the intricacy and customizability necessary to provide players with a challenging and deep city-building experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cities: Skylines II, you create a whole world from terrarium beginnings. You start by zoning your districts, then adding functionality with electricity and plumbing before building serviceable districts to attract and placate dedicated citizens. I unintentionally recreated the town I grew up in, shoving all the industrial features to the side with the power and water facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite its sandbox impression, Cities: Skylines II has an engaging progression system, offering rewards as you scale from a tiny village into a bustling megalopolis. Each milestone achieved delivers Development Points you can use in infrastructure trees to unlock systems like police and parks, while expansion permits let you extend your city limits and access the resources you need to keep the lights on. Despite how mundane it sounds, unlocking and investing in underground parking and figuring out how it could help my citizens felt revelatory thanks to this guided approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my city became more complex, it opened the door to signature buildings like factories or mansions and more contemporary concerns like pollution and congestion, emboldening me to find Arcadian solutions and give my citizens a better life. Even in success, the locals had plenty to say about it via the in-game Twitter clone Chirper. Just like real social media, there was a mountain of mean things to read about my supposedly terrible choices, with a few compliments smattered in between. How dare I try and use green energy to power the city; it’s far too loud now. It forces you to come to terms with the fact that not every digital person will enjoy your utopian vision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exponential growth of my cities took a toll on the game’s visuals and performance – Cities: Skylines II struggles to keep up with its own ambitious scale. Up close, there are moments of peculiar beauty, where sunlight streams through the gaps of a castle’s battlements, or you catch the shadow cast by your own terraformed mountain. However, from the typical top-down perspective, the world feels flat and somewhat cold, not helped by the systemic chugging, error messages, and frequent crashing, which scuppered pockets of my playtime. While I hope these issues will be resolved for players post-launch, it was disappointing and frustrating to contend with while fine-tuning my pipes, wires, and bus routes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MX9YWu5wkGg" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can zoom in and get attached to the individuals living in your city, clicking on them to learn about their education, family, pets, and socioeconomic status. At one point, I considered demolishing a whole suburb before I spotted one of my uncanny valley citizens doing yoga in the backyard. After reading their factfile, I couldn’t bring myself to destroy their family home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you miss too many citizen complaints, you’re alerted of major problems via booming emergency warnings that disrupt Cities: Skylines II’s calming Brian Eno-esque soundtrack, which is punctuated by appropriately annoying fictional ads. Environmental tragedies constitute hard urban planning lessons, and you’re able to manage traffic control, bunkers, and firefighters to mitigate damage. The first time I witnessed a tornado, it skirted my city’s edges, and I held my breath, praying it wouldn’t reach the center, promptly investing in better protection after the fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Quantifying the nuance of Cities: Skylines II isn’t easy. As I dig deeper into its complicated systems, more and more exciting features are still coming into focus. The sequel is ambitious and wants players to juggle hundreds of considerations as they build towards Elysium, and it delivers in that aspect. Yet, unfortunately, the game’s consistent technical problems tend to mire that calculated success.&lt;/p&gt;

  <title>Sonic Superstars Review – The Folly Of Teamwork

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Sonic Superstars marks a step back to the Genesis-era 2D platforming that put the series on the map and a leap forward by letting three more friends join the adventure. While the former largely succeeds in providing an enjoyable nostalgic experience, the latter fails to allow partners to have the same amount of fun.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As either Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, or Amy, you spin dash your way through a brand new batch of beautifully designed zones. From the twisting vines and lush greenery of Speed Jungle to the gilded architecture of the Golden Capital, Sonic Superstars pops with bright colors and whimsical designs for the new gallery of badniks. Unfortunately, the soundtrack doesn’t have the same highs as some of the previous 2D entries. The music is not bad, but outside of a couple of tracks, most tunes are unmemorable and don’t hit that next gear of toe-tapping goodness I’ve come to expect from the franchise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Platforming holds up its end of the bargain, however. The physics perfectly replicate the feel of Sonic’s Genesis adventures, allowing me to comfortably slip into the action like putting on an old glove. Sonic’s pals sport their familiar specialties: Tails can fly and carry partners, Knuckles can climb walls and glide, and Amy sports an enemy-slaying double jump. Each pulls their weight, so the choice comes down to a matter of preference; Amy became my favorite besides Sonic himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MsL9pKdJ1A8" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zones are large, multi-tiered obstacle courses filled with deviously placed enemies, death traps, and new traversal gimmicks. I liked mechanics such as jumping across speeding rollercoaster trains in a casino zone or transforming into pixelated avatars in a cyberspace-inspired world. Other challenges are a pain, such as carefully navigating a pitch-black jungle with only a glowing butterfly for light – an idea ill-suited for Sonic’s faster-paced style of play. Besides traditional mainline Acts, new character-specific Acts provide decent avenues to sample the other heroes while propelling the narrative.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a whole, levels do a good job of capturing the core fun of Sonic: zipping through elaborate obstacles at breakneck speed while dodging hazards at the last second. That also means they sport the same trial-and-error design ethos of the classic games; you often won’t – or can’t – anticipate a hazard until it’s too late. While not new, I was sometimes frustrated by this approach as going too fast often leads to hitting something that almost feels designed to punish you for doing the thing Sonic and his friends do best. Deaths can feel cheap in some instances, so I’m thankful Superstars does away with the finite lives system of the classic games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chaos Emeralds now grant new powers upon their collection, accessible through a weapon wheel. Powers like Avatar and Vision let you send attacking clones across the screen and reveal hidden rings and platforms, respectively. My favorite is Bullet, which lets me fire myself in a chosen direction for an explosive boost. Since Chaos Emerald portals are hidden instead of appearing at checkpoints, these powers are totally optional and easy to miss. Thus, while these skills can be useful, they also aren’t vital. I often forget I have them at my disposal and rarely feel guilty about not using them more. Anything can easily be conquered with your base moveset, and while the powers don’t detract, they’re not as meaningful to the experience as I hoped.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/07/21/8603613a/golden_capital_-_shot_3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/07/21/6b84c52b/emerald_power_-_avatar.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/07/21/0d7a77bc/sky_temple_-_shot_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/07/21/086a11a1/golden_capital_-_shot_2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/06/09/f8565cd6/ss04.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/06/09/989090af/ss13.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the newly added four-player co-op affirms my biggest fear going in: 2D Sonic is not built for traditional multiplayer, at least not with all participants sharing the same screen. Playing with even one other person can be a mess, as going faster or slower than your partner forces you to respawn back to them. Sonic games are about speed, and levels sport numerous paths, but since players aren’t free to explore independently, you’re rubberbanded back together. This creates jarring instances of partners vanishing and warping back if they zigged where you zagged, which can be distracting in the middle of a tricky platforming sequence. Playing co-op feels less like working together and more like fighting to stay together.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Superstars is inconsistent in which player it prioritizes. Generally, Player One is in charge, meaning if someone else dies, the game continues by focusing on the leader. This isn’t the case in some instances, though. In the casino zone, I fell to my death several times; on some occasions, the game refocused on my partner, who continued onward, and I just respawned. In other instances, the camera followed me all the way to my death, resulting in a Game Over for the team. Other challenges seem ill-suited for multiple players; the aforementioned illumination-focused zone is a nightmare with other people since only one player can hold the light, forcing everyone else to either stick extremely close by or wander blindly. Co-op is also restricted to local play only due to quality concerns, but I can’t imagine how it would suffer much from online play. As it stands, co-op is functional and can be unintentionally entertaining in a purely chaotic sense, but doesn’t feel totally thought out.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Battle Mode, a versus destination consisting of bland, one-note mini-game competitions, is hardly worth exploring. The character customization, in which you assemble a robot using parts purchased by spending special coins found in levels or special challenges, is uninteresting as well. A second, more difficult post-game campaign offers the most compelling reason to stick with Superstars after you’ve foiled Dr. Eggman’s plans.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite some big caveats, I mostly enjoyed Sonic Superstars as a solo trip down memory lane. The platforming feels good, the levels are mostly fun, and the presentation looks great. Ripping through robots while hitting loop-de-loops and bounce pads still brings a smile to my face. But the game’s new additions either feel inconsequential or ill-advised, watering down an otherwise respectable package. Sonic Superstars offers a solid return to form for the series’ oldest and most ardent followers, with some hedgehog-sized potholes along the way. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;As a speed-focused arcade racer, Hot Wheels Unleashed 2:&amp;nbsp;Turbocharged is a joy thanks to the emphasis on going fast, collecting Hot Wheels cars spanning decades, and crafting your own tracks. However, it doesn’t quite have the variety of tracks to keep it fresh throughout, and the story mode is an innocuous affair, leading to middle-of-the-pack results instead of the checkered flag it was chasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it may not be as technical as most racing sims or as silly as the Mario Kart series, Turbocharged doesn’t lack charm. Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 drops you onto tracks in a backyard, on a golf course, and in other real-world locations that recreate the memories of a kid who could dream up their masterpiece track and then put it together wherever they’d like. Loop-de-loops, golf balls, giant spiders, and tight corners provide a chaotic and enjoyable challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The focus on speed is fun, making races quick, just-one-more-time affairs. You must master your boost in standard races, obstacle races, boss races, and eliminations, which are my favorite, as you need to keep the lead for a set time as cars are eliminated until yours is the sole survivor.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/16/e8edd35d/hw4.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/16/4e8aa49c/hw5.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/16/a08dce02/hw6.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Your boost bar is crucial since you use it to perform jumps and lateral dashes, two features new to the sequel. Players can use the lateral dash to slam into other cars, but it, along with the jump, can also be used mid-flight to right your vehicle back onto the track, fueling the chaotic control during races. You gain boost via drifting, and thankfully, the mechanic is forgiving and pretty easy to, if not master, at least get a handle on quickly. Different cars have different boosts, which can change how you approach a race. One car may only have three bars max, giving you three boosts, while another has an entire bar that lets you save or burn as much as you need.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figuring out how much and often you can boost around tracks is essential; you may run into a situation where you can’t jump over an obstacle. Limited boost made me enjoy how I had to be just a little strategic in using it. There was more than one instance where I overdid it, finding myself unable to jump over a barrier or boosting right off a course. I never felt cheated, but I had a good laugh and learned from my overexcitement. In those instances, holding a button respawns you with enough boost to try again, though you lose a handful of seconds.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game includes a story mode, Creature Rampage, but it’s mostly a throwaway Saturday morning cartoon affair. Creature Rampage’s premise is simple: Giant monsters are on the loose, and your job is to shrink them down and subdue them by racing, all while listening to jokes from a wisecracking robot, a professor who seems to do more harm than good with his gadgets, and a fellow racer. The story plays out like a motion comic, with panels moving around furiously. It’s all a bit forgettable, and I honestly couldn’t wait for the cutscenes to be over, but it doesn’t linger long enough to get in the way of the races and earning more coins, upgrades, and pieces to customize tracks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The roughly eight-hour story mode does a good job of nudging players to use a variety of cars. The Hot Wheels aren’t just there to look cool; a Rip Rod in the drifter category takes corners like a dream, whereas a swift Mini Cooper is better suited for handling specific track terrain. I liked being pushed to use different cars in various situations, and the types really matter. I used a car unsuited for off-roading and couldn’t navigate dirt corners, encouraging me to explore new cars. After that nudge, I began upgrading my cars to have different boosts or handling benefits via the perks system, and before I knew it, I was customizing my cars with new looks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would have enjoyed more variety in the track locations during Creature Rampage and other modes as you end up racing through much of the same scenery, hearing the same music, and looking at a game that seems stuck in a past console generation with sometimes bland visuals. It isn’t enough to detract from the fun, but you see a lot of the dinosaur museum and golf course before the game is over.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/16/b164fbed/hw7.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/16/c7c2aa9e/hw2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/16/c3829465/hw3.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Seeing this as a virtual play box on top of a racing game is a huge part of the proceedings. The racing is tight, fast, and fun, but the need to earn more coins to buy more cars for your virtual garage is enthralling. Hot Wheels vehicles have several rarity ratings, and as you play, different ones are cycled out in a shop on a timer. So, if you see a van with toast popping out of it, you might impulse buy it before it disappears, like I did. You can also refresh what’s for sale with some coins. I couldn’t stop adding vehicles to my collection; the weirder, the better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upping the customization ante is the track editor. It only took me a couple of minutes to get comfortable with the basics before I was making brutal, unrealistic tracks. It’s definitely a feature that takes some time to fully grasp, but it’s so much fun to select, say, the museum track and start laying down obstacle after obstacle in a winding track of doom and despair. Community tracks allow you to save ones you want to revisit. If you’re even a little bit creative or just like throwing stuff together like me, the track editor and car customization offer plenty of fun ways to get more mileage out of the game.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players can also take on others online in pretty standard fare like a quick race, rounding out the game’s features. Given the creativity present in other portions of the game, the online offerings feel downright vanilla, but it’s still a good time showing off your custom car.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t knock Hot Wheels Unleashed 2: Turbocharged for too much; it’s an enjoyable, arcade-like racer that feels like something you might find in the arcade. It captures what it’s like to be a kid imagining race courses for your toys and offers an almost overwhelming customizable playbox. The quick races and variety in modes never let anything become too dull before you’re on to the next objective, boosting your way to victory. I’m not a Hot Wheels diehard, but the sheer creativity, speed, and customization hooked me.&lt;/p&gt;

Thankfully, Spider-Man 2 meets and exceeds those expectations, providing uniformly stellar superhero action characterized by blazing-fast combat, smart mission design, and regular injections of thrilling set-pieces. Behind all that excitement, it also houses a fervent and heartfelt commentary on second chances, rehabilitation, and redemption. As a result, even in its dark moments, Spider-Man 2 delivers a wholesome and optimistic adventure rooted in joy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After two preceding games establishing the two leads on their own, Spider-Man 2 weaves back and forth between the two wall-crawlers, with unique relationship threads and powers that set them apart, but core story beats and central abilities that unite the experience. Rather than a distraction, the switching dynamic (sometimes dictated by story, and sometimes by player choice) keeps things fresh and often provides exciting cliffhangers or action change-ups at critical moments. The tag-team dynamic is rewarding, and both heroes get the chance to shine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insomniac’s take on web-swinging and traversal through New York City has always been a high point, but it’s given new life here through several additional tricks, including wingsuits that let you glide at high speed across rooftops. Exploring the city is great fun, especially given the vast scope of the urban sprawl and the dozens of discoverables hidden along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The intensity of Spidey’s combat is always a surprise, whether you’re new to these games or returning after some time away. The smoothness of animations, tight camera transitions, and responsive button play keep the speed from feeling overwhelming. I loved experimenting with different powers and gadgets to gain the upper hand against stacked odds. Slotted abilities for each character provide a measure of flexibility to your playstyle, adding at least some minor customization to the flow of battle. Even with that flexibility, Spider-Man 2 is a lengthy game, and the intensity of its frequent conflicts begins to lose its luster after a few dozen hours of punches, kicks, and web throws; it’s always good, but the fading thrill of the minion battles is eventually a victim of the game’s own sprawling scope and size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Countering any eventual tedium in minor encounters, Spider-Man 2 also features some of the most climactic and cinematic action sequences I’ve encountered in a game, easily matching the grandeur and chaos of even the most exciting scenes in Spider-Man’s film outings. These technical showpieces revel in the power of the PS5 hardware; step back from the exhilarating scene, and it’s easy to ask: “How in the world did the developers do that?” High-speed chases, sudden, instantaneous scene changes, and titanic dynamic shifts to the game environment are common and exhilarating – and that’s just in the game’s first 15 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nq1M_Wc4FIc" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In between the action, Spider-Man 2 tries hard to find novelty in smaller moments and simpler gameplay loops, to varying levels of success. It’s odd to say that some of these minor moments would be spoilers, but it’s best to discover them for yourself, as each is inserted to change things up in a way that surprises the player. It’s enough to say that a few sequences of stealth, non-powered locomotion through the city, and memorable evenings out with friends all act as palate cleansers. While these sequences often serve the story well, I’m not always sold on the accompanying gameplay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best comic book stories have often planted real-life societal and personal stories into a backdrop of over-the-top exploits, using the frequent violence to accentuate the themes. Spider-Man 2 takes that idea to heart, constantly challenging the notion of heroism and villainy and coming down on the side that most people are complex and struggling more against their situation in life than it might first appear. Peter and Miles each have challenges to confront. Still, they’re united in a belief about the good in those around them and their willingness to go the extra mile to protect even the most seemingly irredeemable individuals. Spider-Man 2’s storytelling digs into questions about returning from a dark place and having another chance, no matter past mistakes. And while there’s nuance in the answers, the generally optimistic conclusions fall on the side of hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insomniac has nailed that rarest of video game development feats. The team has landed a trilogy of games that all stand strong on their own merits but unite into a sweeping saga made better by experiencing its entirety. While more Spider-Man games will inevitably expand this mythology in new directions, there’s no need to wait. With Spider-Man 2, the developer has found what makes superhero stories worth telling (and retelling) and given&amp;nbsp;its likable heroes the journey they deserve.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Lords of the Fallen captured my interest in its early hours more than its 2014 predecessor of the same name ever did. But despite a solid gameplay foundation, stunning world, and unique two-realm mechanic, by the time I reached credits after 48 hours, I was overjoyed to be done. What begins as a remarkable soft reboot unravels by the halfway point due to pacing issues, abundant repetition, and lackluster level design, unfortunately leaving a disappointing back half to slog through. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lords of the Fallen begins like any other Soulslike. The world – Mournstead, in this instance – is a terrible place to live, but you can save it. You’re tasked by a religious order with lighting five beacons spread across the land to prevent the return of Adyr, a dark god who wants to instill chaos. Your adventure immediately brings you to a treacherous place where even the lowliest of enemies can take down your health bar in just a few hits, but with patience and discipline, these foes are yours to overcome. As you do, you level up and feel stronger and more confident in your ability to move forward. &lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/11/a67920f1/lords_of_the_fallen_vista_cc.jpg" alt="Lords of the Fallen Game Informer review " typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p&gt;What sets Lords of the Fallen’s exploration and action apart from the rest of the genre is its use of two realms: the realm of the living, Axiom, and that of the dead, Umbral. Using a special lamp, you can peer into Umbral at any moment, in real-time. It’s a genuinely impressive mechanic that feels new-gen, even if we are three years into the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S’s lifetimes. Useful as it is to peer into the Umbral, like discovering a wall in between you and a chest in Axiom is no longer there in the opposite realm, the most significant benefit is that upon dying in Axiom, you’re given a second chance – survive through Umbral until you reach a particular emergence point that brings you back to Axiom, with your vigor (currency from killing enemies to level up and purchase items) intact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But surviving is no easy feat, as Umbral is filled with even more enemies than Axiom. At first, exploring Umbral, using the lamp to solve light puzzles and pull platforms toward me, was good fun. But as I continued my journey through Lords of the Fallen, my biggest issue became apparent, highlighted sharply in Umbral: developer Hexworks mistakenly interprets the carefully crafted challenge of a great Soulslike as “add more enemies.” &lt;/p&gt;














  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/11/046da65f/lords_of_the_fallen_skywalk_umbral.jpg" alt="Lords of the Fallen Game Informer review " typeof="foaf:Image" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  







&lt;p&gt;Instead of feeling like I could conquer this section of Umbral or this castle in Axiom, I felt compelled to sprint through it. It’s not that Lords of the Fallen was too hard; instead, it too often felt unfair. I enjoy a formidable adversary or a seemingly insurmountable boss I defeat after 20 tries. However, I don’t enjoy a hallway or staircase with 10 enemies attacking at once, including a miniboss I defeated minutes ago who is now a standard mob enemy. Coupled with a finicky lock-on camera, attempting to defeat each of these mobs in Axiom and Umbral, where even more foes appear, felt terrible. Halfway through my journey, when Lords of the Fallen ran out of new and unique enemies to throw at me and instead recycled the same few I had killed hundreds of times, I no longer felt compelled even to try. My once-exciting adventure felt artificially padded. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Playing through Lords of the Fallen’s lengthy adventure was an odd thing. I was thoroughly enjoying myself: the world design was neat, the two-realm mechanic continued to dazzle, and exploration and combat felt good, as did discovering secrets and shortcuts in Mournstead. But roughly halfway through, Lords of the Fallen ran out of gas, and I ran out of enthusiasm. As if the game became exhausted and petered out, enemies became repetitive, secrets and shortcuts became mundane, and exploration felt stale, as did the world design. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even bosses struggled to thrill in the latter half, with two that particularly stand out as some of the worst I’ve fought in a Soulslike, not because they were tough – they weren’t – but because they were generally unenjoyable, even if I recognize Hexworks’ attempt at doing something different, like an unreachable boss where I had to kill various exploding minions in the vicinity to lower its health.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/11/2f1aa2c0/lords_of_the_fallen_accursedgrove_cc.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/11/f28db51f/lords_of_the_fallen_boglord.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/11/d1e38100/lords_of_the_fallen_lighteaper_cc.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/11/ccd166e8/screenshot_accursedgrovewindmill.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/11/c6cb969b/screenshot_castlevista.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/11/cd5cd868/screenshot_pietafight.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/11/a7b6bb3b/screenshot_swampknight.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
           

&lt;p&gt;Minor annoyances I might have excused in a more streamlined experience, like an often awkward lock-on camera, a couple of consistent bugs, an overuse of minibosses, and enemies that snipe from unseen distances or pursue players for far too long, are accentuated in Lords of the Fallen. Still, Hexworks is on to something here; it’s just not Lords of the Fallen, despite its solid foundation, that can capitalize on it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I rolled credits on Lords of the Fallen, I felt no joy aside from being happy I was done, which is a shame because its first half left me excited for what was yet to come. A beautiful world, distinctive two-realm mechanics, excellent voice acting, and combat that feels good when not over-encumbered by enemies and artificial challenge, create a solid bedrock. But Lords of the Fallen fails to impress beyond that, instead growing more and more frustrating the further into Mournstead adventurers travel.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The previous Detective Pikachu game, released over five years ago on 3DS, traded in traditional Pokémon elements for mysteries more familiar to the Phoenix Wright/Professor Layton crowd. Gone were the trainers, Poké Balls, and battles in exchange for evidence-gathering, deduction, and a Pikachu that can speak far more than its own name. A year later, the movie adaptation became the second highest-grossing video game film at the time. While the game left a central loose thread dangling, the movie, which is disconnected from the game series, tied everything up in a neat bow. Detective Pikachu Returns is left to deal with this discrepancy, impacting the story this game sequel can tell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partners Tim Goodman and the titular Detective Pikachu begin by receiving awards for their investigative work from the previous game. Of course, it doesn’t take long for things to go wrong, and they solve a series of connected mysteries while continuing the search for Tim’s father, Harry. I welcomed their familiar rapport with Tim as the straight man to Pikachu’s gruff, coffee-swigging comic relief. Seeing this relationship grow and evolve as the cases become increasingly personal deeper into the game is great.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The gameplay remains largely the same as you dash through the streets of Ryme City, temple ruins, and other varied locales, chatting with every human and Pokémon you see. This builds out the world, gives personality to the Pokémon via Pikachu’s translation, and compiles evidence for your notebook. Once you have enough on file, it’s time to deduce the facts you’ve probably figured out already but now have the proof to back up. Cases once again wrap up via a multiple-choice quiz as you lay them out and identify the culprit. I appreciated the quality-of-life options that help move things along, like faster movement speed, zippy text navigation, and a fast-forward button for cutscenes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pikachu’s ability to team up with other Pokémon is easily the best addition. Sniffing out a trail with Growlithe, punching through obstacles with Darmanitan, and peering through walls with Luxray all provide a welcome active gameplay break from the constant text scrolling and environment searching. These sequences aren’t revolutionary, but they finally allow you to use some Pokémon powers in this series (Detective Pikachu famously can’t use his powers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Side missions shake things up outside the main case you’re working on. Someone will need help finding a missing Pokémon friend, or a persistent professor will describe one you can keep an eye out for. These open up your singular focus on the main case but provide little payoff. When a new chapter starts, you can scroll a newspaper covering all the NPCs you helped. I did these more out of obligation than pursuing a sense of accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The simple, cartoony visuals are a step up from the long-in-the-tooth 3DS entry and work well for the game's tone. Unfortunately, environmental navigation is stuck in the past. Pesky loading screens are a constant companion as you run back and forth through small chunks of town or navigate floors of buildings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoyed the overall arc and individual case stories, even though you won’t ever really be stumped. However, it's disappointing that the 2019 movie stepped all over some of this game's crucial moments. While many plot elements are markedly different, the ones that line up make me feel like I’ve already seen a spoiler. The only way to come into this story clean is to play the 3DS game and not watch the film. Those who have only seen the movie and expect this game to pick up where it left off will have a jarring experience as specific characters and narrative beats are in different places. Granted, this is solely a review of the game, but you should know what you’re getting into depending on your background with the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While there is room for improvement, the return of this odd pairing with their new bag of tricks is entertaining. Your mind won’t be changed if the style of the previous game wasn't for you, but patient gumshoes should be satisfied with a capable follow-up.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;For years, the Assassin’s Creed franchise has expanded the scope of its entries, offering ever longer adventures across increasingly vast open worlds. For players who first tried the series through those entries, Assassin’s Creed Mirage may be a shock. Set mainly within the single city of ninth-century Baghdad and playable to completion in under 20 hours, Mirage harkens back to the earliest entries starring Altaïr and Ezio. For more longtime fans, many elements will feel like a return to familiar territory, with the commensurate highs and lows that characterized those early installments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;First introduced in 2020’s Assassin’s Creed Valhalla entry where he appeared as an older member of the Brotherhood, Basim is presented here in his early life. We learn of his transition from street thief to Master Assassin, and the plots he uncovers across the city through a series of investigations and assassinations. The return of the mysterious castle of Alamut, the hidden urban bureaus, and the cautious, structured approach to tracking and taking down primary targets – it’s all a nod to the early life of the series. The storytelling and freeform progression of the plot are enjoyable, even if the dialogue feels stiff and formal at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 style="margin-bottom: 11px;"&gt;Watch Our Assassin's Creed Mirage Video Review:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kFaY-QKzKzg" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 11px;"&gt;Gameplay is a distinct return to a predator-prey style; stealth and tool usage are essential, and open conflict against even a few enemies can quickly lead to death. Even in one-on-one encounters, the melee exchanges are not a high point, as they feel rigid and clumsy. On the other hand, Mirage’s missions and contracts often present exciting and curated setups for stealth. Enemy and objective placement is deliberate and thoughtful, forcing players to watch enemies closely and move carefully. The threat of death if discovered is high, which leads to greater tension and engagement with an approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;The dense urban sprawl of Baghdad’s Golden Age is a joy to explore. Lyrical musical melodies follow you along rooftops as russet sunsets paint the sky. Busy street merchants hawk their wares, unwary citizens are ripe for pickpocketing, and hidden chests demand careful observation to reach. High notoriety is a genuine danger as guards converge and hunters track you down. The opportunity for engaging parkour traversal is always present, and moving along rooftops, sliding down zip lines, and diving into hiding spots is great fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IRNOoOYVn80" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Individual missions often have some fun twists and turns, and I like the way the game encourages decisions in the stalking of a target. Choosing between two or three distinct tactical routes provides a sense of creativity. Nailing a complete infiltration with no one the wiser only to slip away in the uproar surrounding your villainous victim’s death is deeply satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;While I enjoy the missions, too many rely on dull investigation areas, where I was forced to scour a zone until I found just the right book or clue to progress. Too often, these devolved into aimless wandering that felt like a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Even so, across the board, the excess that has characterized recent entries seems to have been reined in. The money and favor tokens you earn are valuable and must be spent with care. Acquiring a new tool is a big deal, and can be transformative to approaching a fight. Fewer side missions or activities are on offer, but those here feel curated and purposeful. It’s a more compact game, but I felt driven and engaged with everything I did along the path to its completion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-bottom:11px"&gt;Mirage teases a larger mystery that connects to Basim’s role in the earlier Valhalla release. But in this case, the resolution of that mystery is unsatisfying and feels like an odd wrap-up to an otherwise self-contained narrative. Concerns about the conclusion aside, I still had a wonderful time in Baghdad’s ancient alleys and palaces. Not everything is perfect, but the “less is more” design philosophy goes a long way to making this one of the most consistently engaging titles within the series for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

      Everyone
      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;It can be rare for a newer franchise to challenge a well-established genre leader for the throne, but that’s precisely what the Forza Motorsport series has done since its first entry in 2005. Since then, the sim-racing genre has featured dueling front-runners, with Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport taking turns in the lead. The latest entry, simply titled Forza Motorsport, takes a back-to-basics approach to keep pace with its chief rival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speeding around the track has never felt better. A palpable sense of speed accompanies excellent physics and visuals to create a superb racing experience. A multitude of factors converge, including track surface, weather, the wear of your tires, and the various tuning elements of your vehicle, to determine how your vehicle handles and feels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the hundreds of laps I drove, I can’t remember any instance when I skidded off the track or allowed an opponent to overtake me where I didn’t immediately understand what I did wrong. However, a penalty system meant to discourage cutting corners or ramming opponents is less spelled out; one intentionally caused crash yielded no penalty, while the same system docked me more than a second for some routine paint-trading around a corner. I appreciate what it sets out to do, but the inconsistent penalties caused me to throw my hands up in disbelief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yd96SmBeAz8" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Single-player races are spiced up by the series’ trademark Drivatar feature, which helps A.I. drivers behave more like real players. I love that it replicates player tendencies and their mistakes; I still occasionally see A.I. drivers spinning out onto the track-side rubble. This dynamic behavior helps add variety to an otherwise straightforward career mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forza Motorsport’s career mode was where I spent the most time. The campaign presents you with different themed cups and tours in which to compete. These include some requiring you to drive a specific performance class or fall into a certain classification bucket like high-powered performance vehicles or sedans. I appreciate the simple nature of playing through various cups in successive order, though I would have liked more freedom in the mode’s progression and car collection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you race, you earn credits, which can be used to buy more cars, but you also level cars up in an odd RPG-lite twist. As you complete certain feats on the track, your car gains levels. I quickly became hooked on posting the best times on individual track segments to gain more experience. However, I don’t like that upgrade components are locked behind your car level. These arbitrary level gates made me less interested in going in and tweaking my cars’ parts manually; instead of trying to figure out which parts were unlocked with my newest level-up, I often opted just to have the game optimize the upgrade for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who want to compete against real people instead of their Drivatars, Forza Motorsports’ capable multiplayer suite offers several avenues to take on racers from across the globe. Featured races offer a diverse array of events starring different cars in the expansive Forza garage with a set start time, but I loved jumping into instant-action Rivals events, where you’re tasked with beating another player’s time. These delivered some of my most triumphant moments as I finally nailed the perfect lap to top my foe.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/03/6ca18f31/forza_motorsport_xboxgamesshowcase2023-presskit-02-16x9_wm.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/09/82aff336/fm.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/03/5f37fc05/forza_motorsport_xboxgamesshowcase2023-presskit-04-16x9_wm.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/03/06f13742/forza_motorsport_night_race.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/03/86f79b03/forza_motorsport_xboxgamesshowcase2023-presskit-06-16x9_wm.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/10/03/78671982/forza_motorsport_xboxgamesshowcase2023-presskit-09-16x9_wm.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/25/141cd73e/kyalami.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/25/d0b5119c/forza1.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/25/84cdf0e9/forza2.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/01/25/b1ef458d/forza_motorsport-xboxgamesshowcase2022-presskit-07-16x9_wm-65d9e47359a2ca761898.jpg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;Even in a field full of stellar-looking racing games, Forza Motorsport is a visual feast. Each of the 20 tracks features intricate details and weather that make it feel like a lived-in world, but the cars are the true stars of the show. Whether you’re driving around in common street cars from Honda and Ford, supercars from Ferrari and McLaren, or the various racing-tuned speed machines on offer, each vehicle’s impressive look and sound match the uncompromised feel of the on-the-track action.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can visually customize each of the more than 500 launch cars with custom paint jobs and vinyls, but I’m disappointed by the limited body-customization options. I’m also underwhelmed by the damage, which is a shame since so much of the game is built around attention to detail. Even when I drove directly into a wall at nearly 200 miles per hour or got T-boned by a rival and rolled, my car escaped with minor dings and dents. No matter how realistically the dirt accumulates around precise parts of a car over the course of a race, my immersion broke each time I was in an accident. The lack of overt damage is particularly noticeable when you have the performance-impacting damage setting from higher difficulties on and your car is struggling to stay on the road, but it looks like it was in little more than a fender bender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forza Motorsport may not have the most in-depth career mode, but it executes nearly every aspect of the package exceptionally well. Though some of the progression and dynamic visual elements fall short of the realism the rest of the title achieves, Forza Motorsport currently vies for the pole position in the sim-racer field.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;The abstract environmental puzzle game has become its own genre in recent years, with some telling stories that are strange but easy to parse and others being so opaque that the player can ascribe almost any meaning to what is transpiring on screen. On this difficult-to-define spectrum, Cocoon lands on the latter half of the scale. I basically never had any idea why I was doing what I was doing or what the larger goal was, but I didn’t mind for a moment because the puzzles scratch your brain so effectively that I was always eager to complete whatever strange task it put in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" frameBorder="0"  allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xub7_FhlWws" width=""&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Cocoon, you are a winged bug creature with limited flight abilities who must move marble-like globes from point to point. Simply moving the protagonist around the world feels fantastic, and engaging with the world is simple. You don’t jump or attack enemies. Every interaction is handled with one button. The fluidity of movement and simplicity of engagement leave you to fully concentrate on the puzzle task and take in the always impressive animation of the environment and various creatures that inhabit it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The core hook of Cocoon is the globes your character can pick up and move. Each globe contains a world within it, and the process of moving through the game and solving its puzzles involves jumping into and out of these worlds, taking advantage of the abilities they offer while you hold them. The orange globe, for example, makes certain paths appear, and the green globe lets you move up and down certain platforms. The puzzle-solving emerges from figuring out how to carry the globes you need into the correct worlds. Cocoon impressively manages this potentially brain-breaking puzzle mechanic without ever getting too complicated and making you feel like you’re climbing deeper and deeper into an ever-shrinking series of worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;section class='type:slideshow'&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/19/a0d125b5/cocoon_screenshot_13.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/19/caaf7bee/cocoon_screenshot_3.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/19/1168edde/cocoon_screenshot_14.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/19/ba9d5592/cocoon_screenshot_4.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/19/679cbe82/cocoon_screenshot_15.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/19/59a720e5/cocoon_screenshot_5.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/19/d8f4ae59/cocoon_screenshot_16.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/19/0873515b/cocoon_screenshot_6.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src='https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/19/fc836634/cocoon_screenshot_17.jpeg'&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/section&gt;
          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;The one frustration from this process is that solving a puzzle often builds to knowing where and how you need to position your globes and carrying them one at a time to their destination. Thankfully, it never gets too tedious, but there are a few instances where I felt I was going through a motion to finish a puzzle as opposed to arriving at a moment of brilliant catharsis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the abstract art direction, which pushes you through a series of strange, seemingly organic structures, I never found myself in a position where I wasn’t sure which direction I needed to go. Environmental clues, or the occasional key that floats alongside you, help tell you which direction to head toward. I always felt like I was making progress and never banging my head against a puzzle I didn’t understand.&lt;/p&gt;

          &amp;nbsp;

&lt;p&gt;A few boss fights break up the puzzle-solving, and I always looked forward to meeting them. It is in these instances where the experience gets closest to resembling an action game. You’re not so much attacking an enemy in the traditional sense but rather making sure to be in the right position until they are defeated. I enjoyed the challenge of every boss encounter and breaking down how to overcome them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps Cocoon’s biggest triumph is its pace and how well it hands out new globe-based abilities all the way up to the end. The game excels at making you an expert on how to use a specific ability to solve a puzzle and then continue to use that ability in tandem with the new ones you’ve discovered. World-hopping certainly has the potential to get over-complicated, but Cocoon shows restraint in the interest of creating a better puzzle game, and it pays off. I don’t know that I will ever fully understand what transpired during my molecular journey on Cocoon’s alien world, but its imagery and puzzles will stay with me for some time.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;p&gt;Gaming franchises need to evolve to stay relevant. Whether it's expanding on certain mechanics or overhauling quality-of-life features, any great series that's been around as long as Bomberman is forced to make changes or be left in the dust. Unfortunately for Super Bomberman R 2, the changes it makes to the formula are mostly unsuccessful. While games with your friends can be thrilling, online play is hit-or-miss, and its story mode is a huge letdown. I respect Konami for trying new things with Bomberman. In this case, it just turned out to be a misfire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, a disclaimer. I primarily reviewed the game on the Switch. When I booted it up, however, I was taken aback by the poor graphics. Textures are notably blurry, the lighting is flat, and shadows are pixelated. &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/games/super_bomberman_r/b/switch/archive/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-game-informer-review.aspx"&gt;The first Super Bomberman R&lt;/a&gt; – a launch title for the Switch – looks much better in comparison. The difference between the Switch and PlayStation 5 versions is night and day. Performance-wise, the games feel the same, but if you want decent-looking visuals, especially in the story mode, I'd recommend any non-Switch version.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/28/e6858048/super_bomberman_r_2_planet_fulvita.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  


&lt;/a&gt;





A screenshot of Super Bomberman R 2 on switch. Blocky mushrooms like those on the left are commonplace on the first planet.

&lt;p&gt;The main story is the worst part of this game. It opens with a series of cutscenes introducing the protagonist, White. He lives with the other seven Bomberman siblings, each of which is written with the explicit purpose of annoying him. The writers have done such a great job at making them annoying that I found these cutscenes excruciating, and would have skipped as many as possible if not writing a review. It doesn't help that lines are read slowly, with over-the-top performances that get old immediately. The gist of these cutscenes is that a mysterious Black Moon is attacking planets, and the Bomberman crew is off to stop them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The gameplay of story mode attempts to fuse classic Bomberman gameplay with a pseudo-open-world design. As you explore three different planets, you find cute little creatures called Ellons that have the ability to power technology. Up to five can follow you, and you use them to unlock fast travel points, but they can also be killed by your bombs, so you must keep them close to avoid getting hurt. Meanwhile, your total Ellon count is used to open gates to new areas or enemy bases. The hunt for Ellons gets stale quickly for a simple reason; Bomberman's toolset is not designed for exploration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you destroy blocks, you level up to gain experience and unlock new powers, but most of these powers don't mesh with the design of this mode. While the abilities to punch bombs over walls and move faster are both useful, increasing your bomb's explosion size often felt like an inconvenience, rather than an upgrade. Unfortunately, you get no say in which abilities you want to upgrade, because they're automatically unlocked at certain levels.&lt;/p&gt;












&lt;a class="linkoriginal" data-featherlight="image" href=""&gt;

  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/28/0795143f/super_bomberman_r_2_exploring_planet_aquastar.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  


&lt;/a&gt;







&lt;p&gt;In a party game, comically large explosions are fun, even when they result in self-destruction. If it makes you angry, you can jump right back into a new match seconds later. But in story mode, explosions kill any Ellons following you, and if you're out of lives, you must retrace your steps through areas you've already played. Because of this dissonance between player ability and world design, the bulk of the story is frustrating at worst and boring at best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The one part of the story mode that kind of works is also Super Bomberman R 2’s main innovation – Castle Mode. Players design a base to guard their treasure, setting up walls and hazards they normally encounter out in the world. By the late-game sequences, I was happy with my base, as I'm pretty sure I constructed an area the A.I. was literally unable to access. I'm not sure if that was the intended experience, but it was a glimpse of joy amidst an otherwise annoying game mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also raid enemy bases, but there's an added level of difficulty there. Konami has translated the Bomberman siblings' irritating nature into a gameplay mechanic, and while it might seem like they're on your side during these raids, if they reach the treasure chest first, you lose. It's an odd decision that I didn't process for the first few raids, but I admire the consistency between the characters' personalities and their in-game disruption. Still, this added obstacle frustrated me more than it engaged me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Luckily, the game is more than just its story mode. Competitive battle modes make a return as well, and you can play both locally and online. The highlight is the Battle 64 mode, which originated in the now-defunct Super Bomberman R Online. Similar to games like Tetris 99 and F-Zero 99, it pits you against 63 other players in a series of interconnected stages. As a solo player playing online, this mode was the most consistent fun I had.&lt;/p&gt;












&lt;a class="linkoriginal" data-featherlight="image" href=""&gt;

  
    

  
      
            &lt;img loading="lazy" src="https://www.gameinformer.com/sites/default/files/styles/body_default/public/2023/09/28/c7ea6250/super_bomberman_r_2_battle_64.jpg" typeof="foaf:Image" alt="" class="image-style-body-default" /&gt;
      
  


&lt;/a&gt;





A Steam Screenshot of Battle 64 mode.

&lt;p&gt;It also features standard mode, crystals mode, castle mode, and more, but if you want to play online, you'll only be able to play whatever mode is available in the current window. For example, today I could only play Battle 64 mode from 8-11 AM, Standard from 1-2 PM, and Crystals from 2-3 PM. I also had some issues with encountering human players. In the Standard window, for instance, I matched with the same person three times in a row, and we were the only two people (out of the usual four) in the lobby. They were also way better than me, but I had no choice but to play them in a one-on-one battle. Despite that experience, online play can be enjoyable, but it gets repetitive being locked into a single mode for hours at a time. With a smaller player base, I understand why Konami needs to funnel them together for a better online experience, but that doesn’t make it fun in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Super Bomberman R 2’s best parts are the ones carried over from older games in the series. Messing around with friends in local and online matches is still fun, and if that's all you're interested in, it's a fine enough experience. Unfortunately, that’s a small portion of the game, making it hard to recommend.&lt;/p&gt;
